##### [A Photometric and Kinematic Analysis of UDG1137+16: Probing Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy Formation in a Group Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00598)

- #galaxy/dwarf #galaxy/udg 
- Our new analyses confirm both its environmental association with the low density UGC 6594 group, along with its large size of 3.3 kpc and status as a UDG.
	- The new imaging reveals two distinct stellar components for UDG1137+16, indicating that a central stellar body is surrounded by an outer stellar envelope undergoing tidal interaction.
- We measure a stellar velocity dispersion within the half-light radius (15 ± 4 km s−1) and find that UDG1137+16 is similar to some other UDGs in that it is likely dark matter dominated.

##### [Rapid sorting of radio galaxy morphology using Haralick features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00843)

- #galaxy/morphology
- The set of thirteen Haralick features represent an extremely compact non-parametric representation of image texture, and are calculated directly from imagery using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
- 基于LoTSS数据：we demonstrate that Haralick features are highly efficient, rotationally invariant descriptors of radio galaxy morphology.
- 同时利用HDBSCAN技术进行分类
- 关于Haralick特征：
	- Haralick features were introduced by Haralick et al. (1973) as a statistical method of examining image texture.  They consider the relationship between the intensity of neighbouring pixels and are useful in classifying similar regions in an image given the local spatial distribution of pixel intensities.
	-  Haralick features are based on the so-called Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). To compute the Haralick features, one must first compute the GLCM, which can then be used to evaluate the Haralick coefficients.

- #cosmology/sz 
- We measure the kSZ effect due to ionized gas traced by infrared-selected galaxies from the \\emph{unWISE} catalog. 
	- We employ the "projected-field" kSZ estimator, which does not require spectroscopic galaxy redshifts.
- Using a new "asymmetric" estimator that combines different foreground-cleaned CMB maps to maximize the signal-to-noise, we measure the kSZ2\-galaxy cross-power spectrum
	- 对z=0.6, 1.1, 1.5的三个样本得到了探测
	- We discuss possible explanations for the excess kSZ signal associated with the z≈1.1 sample, and show that foreground contamination in the CMB maps is very unlikely to be the cause.

- 关于CMB B-mode偏振探测中的去除lensing效应的影响：the lensing effects can be partially removed by combining high-resolution E\-mode measurements with an estimate of the projected matter distribution. 
	- For near-future experiments, the best estimate of the latter will arise from co-adding internal reconstructions (derived from the CMB itself) with external tracers of the large-scale structure such as the cosmic infrared background (CIB).
- Mitigation techniques based on multi-frequency cleaning appear to be very effective.
- By means of an analytic model, that the bias arising from the higher-point functions of the CIB itself ought to be negligible.

##### [A Search for correlations between turbulence and star formation in LITTLE THINGS dwarf irregular galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00040)

- We looked for relationships between SF traced by FUV images, and gas turbulence traced by kinetic energy density (KED) and velocity dispersion
- The excess KED associated with SF implies a ∼0.5% efficiency for supernova energy to pump local HI turbulence on the scale of resolution here, which is a factor of ∼2 too small for all of the turbulence on a galactic scale.
	- The excess vdisp in SF regions is also small
- The local excess in ΣHI corresponding to an excess in ΣSFR is consistent with an HI consumption time of ∼1.6 Gyr in the inner parts of the galaxies.

##### [A Graphical Interpretation of Circumgalactic Precipitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00056)

- #galaxy/cgm 
- 目前关于CGM的一个假设： a self-regulating feedback loop suspends the gas density of the ambient CGM close to the galaxy in a state with a ratio of cooling time to freefall time >10.
	- 当这个比值小于10，冷气体会从CGM中凝结出来，集中落向星系中心，触发新的feedback
	- The astrophysical origin of this so-called precipitation limit is not simple but is critical to understanding the CGM and its role in galaxy evolution
- 本文尝试从概念上解释：It illustrates how the precipitation limit can depend on both the global configuration of a galactic atmosphere and the degree to which dynamical disturbances drive CGM perturbations.

##### [The central parsec of NGC 3783: a rotating broad emission line region, asymmetric hot dust structure, and compact coronal line region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00068)

- SINFONI + GRAVITY: We find the BLR probed through broad Brγ emission is well described by a rotating, thick disk with a radial distribution of clouds peaking in the inner region
- In our BLR model the physical mean radius of 16 light days is nearly twice the 10 day time lag that would be measured, which matches very well the 10 day time lag that has been measured by reverberation mapping.
- 看到的热尘埃结构有offset迹象：可能是正被吸积的团块
- We directly measure the FWHM size of the nuclear CLR as traced by the \[CaVIII\] and narrow Brγ line. We find a FWHM size of 2.2 mas (0.4 pc), fully in line with the expectation of the CLR located between the BLR and narrow line region.

##### [A new analytic ram pressure profile for satellite galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00132)

- 冲压剥离理论模型的比较：传统的beta-profile缺乏对halo质量和距离halo中心距离的依赖
- we introduce a new universal analytic model for the profiles consisting in a damped power law, and we provide a new set of fitted parameters which can recover the ram pressure dependence on halo mass and redshifts.
- We find the number of galaxies experiencing large amounts of accumulated ram pressure stripping have low stellar mass
	- Their specific star formation rates depend significantly on the ram pressure modelling, particularly at high redshifts (z\>1.5).

##### [Detection of an ionized gas outflow in the extreme UV-luminous star-forming galaxy BOSS-EUVLG1 at z=2.47](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00774)

	- We report the detection of a broad Hα component carrying 25% of the total Hα flux. 指示了一个大质量的高速外流；外流速度接近600km/s
	- 外流可以用SF解释，不需要AGN; 而且mass loading factor显示外流不足以quench SF；只有少部分外流能超过逃逸速度
- The ionized phase of the outflow does not carry the mass and energy to play a relevant role neither in the evolution of the host galaxy nor in the enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

##### [Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder: I. System Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01870) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01870.pdf)

- ASKAP is one of the first radio telescopes to deploy phased array feed (PAF) technology on a large scale, giving it an instantaneous field of view that covers 31 square degrees at 800 MHz.
- As a two-dimensional array of 36x12m antennas, with baselines ranging from 22m to 6km, ASKAP also has excellent snapshot imaging capability and 10 arcsecond resolution.
- It is an excellent telescope for surveys between 700 MHz and 1800 MHz and is expected to facilitate great advances in our understanding of galaxy formation, cosmology and radio transients while opening new parameter space for discovery of the unknown.

##### [Toward a more stringent test of gravity with redshift space power spectrum: simultaneous probe of growth and amplitude of large-scale structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01785) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01785.pdf)

- #cosmology/rsd #ssst/cos
- In the presence of galaxy bias, however, the RSD measurement at large scales, where the linear theory prediction is safely applied, is known to exhibit a degeneracy between the parameters of structure growth f and fluctuation amplitude sigma8, and one can only constrain the parameters in the form of fsigma8.
- In order to disentangle this degeneracy, in this paper, we go beyond the linear theory, and consider the model of RSD applicable to a weakly nonlinear regime.
- We show that upcoming galaxy survey of the stage-IV class can unambiguously determine sigma8 at the precision down to 10% at higher redshifts even if we restrict the accessible scales to k<0.16h/Mpc

##### [Information Content of Higher-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01696) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01696.pdf)

- Constraints available from joint analysis of the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 3-Point Correlation Function) can, in some cases, exceed those offered by the initial power spectrum even when the reconstruction is perfect.
- In particular, we show that for the z = 0 real-space matter field in the limit of vanishing shot noise, taking modes up to k_max = 0.2 h/Mpc, using the bispectrum alone offers a factor of two reduction in the variance on the cosmic distance scale relative to that available from the power spectrum.

- #galaxy_halo
- "the spin$-$orbit alignment (SOA)"  - a coherence between the spin vector of a galaxy and the orbital motion of its neighbors.
- 在Illustris模拟中:
	- (a) There exists a clear preference for prograde orientations (i.e., SOA) for galaxy pairs, qualitatively consistent with observations.
	- (b) The SOA is significant for both baryonic and dark matter spins, being the strongest for gas and the weakest for dark matter.
	- (c) The SOA is stronger for less massive targets and for targets having closer neighbors.
	- (d) The SOA strengthens for galaxies in low-density regions, and the signal is dominated by central$-$satellite pairs in low-mass halos.
	- (e) There is an explicit dependence of the SOA on the duration of interaction with its current neighbor.
- Taken together, we propose that the SOA witnessed at $z = 0$ has been developed mainly by interactions with a neighbor for an extended period of time, rather than tidal torque from the ambient large-scale structure.

##### [On the relation between Lya absorbers and local galaxy filaments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01713) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01713.pdf)

- #galaxy/igm
- We aim at characterising the relation between Lya absorbers and nearby overdense cosmological structures (galaxy filaments) at recession velocities Delta v \leq 6700 km/s by using archival observational data from various instruments.
- Along the 91 sightlines that pass close to a filament, we identify 215 (227) Lya absorption systems (components).
	- Among these, 74 Lya systems are aligned in position and velocity with the galaxy filaments, indicating that these absorbers and the galaxies trace the same large-scale structure.
- The strongest Lya absorbers are preferentially found near galaxies or close to the axis of a filament, although there is substantial scatter in this relation.

##### [Improved Treatment of Host-Galaxy Correlations in Cosmological Analyses With Type Ia Supernovae](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01776) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01776.pdf)

- Using a spectroscopically-confirmed sample of $\sim$1600 SNIa, we develop the first empirical model of underlying populations for SNIa light-curve properties that includes their dependence on host-galaxy stellar mass.
- These populations are important inputs to simulations that are used to model selection effects and correct distance biases within the BEAMS with Bias Correction (BBC) framework.
- Here we improve BBC to also account for SNIa-host correlations, and we validate this technique on simulated data samples.
- We recover the input relationship between SNIa luminosity and host-galaxy stellar mass (the mass step, $\gamma$) to within 0.004 mags, which is a factor of 5 improvement over the previous method that results in a $\gamma$-bias of ${\sim}0.02$.
- We adapt BBC for a novel dust-based model of intrinsic brightness variations, which results in a greatly reduced mass step for data ($\gamma = 0.017 \pm 0.008$), and for simulations ($\gamma =0.006 \pm 0.007$).
- Analysing simulated SNIa, the biases on the dark energy equation-of-state, $w$, vary from $\Delta w = 0.006(5)$ to $0.010(5)$ with our new BBC method; these biases are significantly smaller than the $0.02(5)$ $w$-bias using previous BBC methods that ignore SNIa-host correlations.

##### [Orphan galaxies in semi-analytic models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01837) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01837.pdf)

- #galaxy/sam #galaxy_halo
- The model proposed takes into account the dynamical friction drag, mass loss by tidal stripping and a proximity merger criterion, also it is simple enough to be inexpensive from a computational point of view.
- We show that while the halo mass function fails to put tight constraints on the dynamical friction, the addition of clustering information helps to better define the parameters of the model related to the spatial distribution of subhalos.
- Using the model with the best fit parameters allows us to reproduce the halo mass function to a precision better than 5 per cent, and the two point correlation function at a precision better than 10 per cent.

##### [The AMBRE Project: Origin and evolution of sulfur in the Milky Way](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01961) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01961.pdf)

- Sulfur is a volatile chemical element that plays an important role in tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies.
- We find that the [S/M] abundances ratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime, and then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]~-1.0dex.
	- This decrease continues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently reported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models.
	- Moreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very different kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich and sulfur-poor ones.

##### [A new panchromatic classification of unclassified Burst Alert Telescope active galactic nuclei](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02044) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02044.pdf)

- Focusing on the 36 sources with measured redshift, we compute their spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to $\gamma$-rays with the aim to classify these objects.
- We found a large fraction of absorbed radio-quiet AGNs (31 out of 36) and some additional rare radio-loud sources (5 out of 36), since the jet emission in hard X-rays is important for aligned jets owing to the boost produced by the beaming effect.
- With our work we can confirm the hypothesis that a number of galaxies, whose optical spectra lack AGN emission features, host an obscured active nucleus.

##### [3D Modelling and Visualisation of Observed Galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02141) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02141.pdf)

- #cluster/icm #cluster/galaxy
- ALMA, ATCA, MUSE, Herschel; gas-to-dust ratios in 15 Fornax cluster galaxies 大部分是矮星系
- Gas-to-dust ratios in Fornax galaxies are systematically lower than those in field galaxies at fixed stellar mass/metallicity.
- This implies that a relatively large fraction of the metals in these Fornax systems is locked up in dust, which is possibly due to altered chemical evolution as a result of the dense environment.
- 不仅是HI气体比例低，分子气体也很缺乏; 和Virgo cluster不一样
- We propose various explanations for the low H$_2$-to-dust ratios in the Fornax cluster, including the more efficient stripping of H$_2$ compared to dust, more efficient enrichment of dust in the star formation process, and altered ISM physics in the cluster environment.

- #galaxy/bcg #galaxy/halo
- We explore the stellar mass density and colour profiles of 118 low redshift,

- However, we also see a flattening of the profile ($\Sigma_* \sim 10^{7.5}$ M$_\odot$ kpc$^{-2}$) in the outskirts (up to 10 R$_{\mathrm{e}}$), which is revealed by our method of specifically targeting tidal/accretion features.
	- 这个变平很可能和PDR2 sky background的under-subtraction有关

- Three edge-on lenticular galaxies from the Fornax3D project -- FCC 153, FCC 170, and FCC 177 -- in order to infer their mass assembly histories individually and in the context of the Fornax cluster.
	- We find that the galaxies studied here have all been able to form dynamically-cold (intrinsic vertical velocity dispersion $\sigma_z \lesssim 50\ {\rm km}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$) stellar disks after cluster infall.
	- The pre-existing (old) high angular momentum components have retained their angular momentum (orbital circularity $\lambda_z > 0.8$) through to the present day.
- 和NGC3115这种低密度环境下的星系比，可以看到因为cluster环境导致的恒星吸积和并合过程的减少
- There is tentative evidence for enhancement in the luminosity-weighted intrinsic vertical velocity dispersion due to the cluster environment.
	- But importantly, there is an indication that metallicity may be a key driver of this relation.

- In Necib $\&$ Lin (2021), we introduced a strategy to robustly measure the escape velocity. 本文加入了对银河系子结构的考虑
- Based on a fit with three bound components to account for the disk, relaxed halo, and the Gaia Sausage, we find the escape velocity of the Milky Way at the solar position to be $v_{\rm{esc}}= 484.6^{+17.8}_{-7.4}$ km/s.
- Assuming a Navarro-Frenck-White dark matter profile, and taken in conjunction with a recent measurement of the circular velocity at the solar position of $v_c = 230 \pm 10$ km/s, we find a Milky Way concentration of $c_{200} = 13.8^{+6.0}_{-4.3}$ and a mass of $M_{200} = 7.0^{+1.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, which is considerably lighter than previous measurements.

- We confirm that a significant gamma-ray signal is observed within the characteristic radius $\theta_{500}$ of the Coma cluster, with a test statistic TS~27 for our baseline model. Coma星系团中的Gamma-ray信号
- The presence of a possible point source may account for most of the observed signal.

- Assuming an hadronic origin of the signal, our results provide the first quantitative measurement of the cosmic ray proton content in a cluster.

##### [Probing the physical properties of the intergalactic medium using gamma-ray bursts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02530) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02530.pdf)

- #galaxy/igm
- We use Gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra total continuum absorption to estimate the key intergalactic medium (IGM) properties of hydrogen column density ($\mathit{N}\textsc{hxigm}$), metallicity, temperature and ionisation parameter over a redshift range of $1.6 \leq z \leq 6.3$, using photo-ionisation (PIE) and collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) models for the ionised plasma.
- We find that the IGM property results are similar, regardless of whether the model assumes all PIE or CIE.
- The PIE model implies a less rapid decline in average metallicity with redshift compared to CIE.
- Using our model, we conclude that the IGM contributes substantially to the total absorption seen in GRB spectra and that this contribution rises with redshift, explaining why the hydrogen column density inferred from X-rays is substantially in excess of the intrinsic host contribution measured in UV.

- #cluster/galaxy 
- We searched for jellyfish galaxy candidates in a sample of 40 clusters from the DAFT/FADA and CLASH surveys covering the redshift range 0.2<z<0.9.
	- We found 81 jellyfish candidates in the extended region around MACS0717, and 97 in 22 other clusters.
	- We find that jellyfish candidates tend to be star forming objects, with blue colours, young ages, high star formation rates and specific star formation rates.
- Jellyfish galaxy candidates in MACS0717 tend to avoid the densest regions of the cluster, while this does not appear to be the case in the other clusters.

- #galaxy_halo
- We study subhalo orbital evolution using numerical calculations in which subhaloes are modelled as massless particles orbiting in a time-varying spherical potential.
- We find that the radial action of the subhalo orbit decreases over the first few orbits, indicating that the response to the growth of the host halo is not adiabatic during this phase. The subhalo orbits can shrink by a factor of $\sim$1.5 in this phase.
- Given these results, we consider the spatial distribution of the population of subhaloes identified in high-resolution cosmological simulations.
	- We find that it is consistent with this population having been accreted at z < 3, indicating that any subhaloes accreted earlier are unresolved in the simulations. 过早吸积进来的subhalo已经无法分辨

- Using high-state observations with simultaneous X-ray and UV/optical measurements, we investigate whether super-Eddington accreting AGNs exhibit different accretion disk-corona connections compared to sub-Eddington accreting AGNs.
- We find tight correlations between the X-ray-to-UV/optical spectral slope parameter ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and the monochromatic luminosity at $2500~\r{A}$($L_{\rm 2500~\r{A}}$) for both the super- and sub-Eddington subsamples.
- Super-Eddington accreting AGNs are not particularly X-ray weak in general compared to sub-Eddington accreting AGNs.
- A fraction of super-Eddington accreting AGNs show strong X-ray variability, probably due to small-scale gas absorption, and we highlight the importance of employing high-state (intrinsic) X-ray radiation to study the accretion disk-corona connections in AGNs.

##### [Radio multifrequency observations of galaxy clusters. The Abell 399$-$401 pair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02900) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02900.pdf)

- Galaxy clusters are assembled via merging of smaller structures, in a process that generates shocks and turbulence in the intra cluster medium and produces radio emission in the form of halos and relics.
- The cluster pair A 399-A 401 represents a special case: both clusters host a radio halo and recent LOFAR observations at 140~MHz revealed the presence of a radio bridge connecting the two clusters and two candidate relics, one South of A 399 and the other in between the two clusters in proximity of a shock front detected in X-ray observations.
- In this paper we present Westerbork observations at 1.7, 1.4 and 1.2~GHz and 346~MHz of the A 399-A 401 cluster pair.
- We detected the radio halo in the A 399 cluster at 346~MHz, extending up to $\sim 650$~kpc and with a $125 \pm 6$~mJy flux density.
- Its spectral index between 1.4~GHz and 346~MHz and between 140~MHz and 346~MHz is $\alpha = 1.47 \pm 0.05$, and $\alpha = 1.75 \pm 0.14$respectively.
- The two candidate relics are also seen at 346~MHz and we determined their spectral index to be $\alpha = 1.10 \pm 0.14$and $\alpha = 1.46 \pm 0.14$.
- The low surface brightness bridge connecting the two clusters is below the noise level at 346~MHz, therefore we constrained the bridge average spectral to be steep, i.e $\alpha > 1.5$at $2\sigma$confidence level.
- This result favours the scenario where dynamically-induced turbulence is a viable mechanism to reaccelerate a population of mildly relativistic particles and amplify magnetic fields even in cluster bridges, i.e on scales of a few Mpcs.

##### [Bar-like galaxies in IllustrisTNG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03076) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03076.pdf)

- We study a sample of bar-like galaxies in the Illustris TNG100 simulation, in which almost the whole stellar component is in the form of a prolate spheroid.
- The sample is different from the late-type barred galaxies studied before.
- In addition to the requirement of a high enough stellar mass and resolution, the 277 galaxies were selected based on the single condition of a low enough ratio of the intermediate to long axis of the stellar component.
- We followed the mass and shape evolution of the galaxies as well as their interactions with other objects and divided them into three classes based on the origin of the bar and the subsequent history.
- In galaxies of class A (comprising 28% of the sample), the bar was induced by an interaction with a larger object, most often a cluster or group central galaxy, and the galaxies were heavily stripped of dark matter and gas.
- In classes B and C (27% and 45% of the sample, respectively) the bars were induced by a merger or a passing satellite, or they were formed by disk instability.
- Class B galaxies were then partially stripped of mass, while those of class C evolved without strong interactions, thus retaining their dark matter and gas in the outskirts.
- We illustrate the properties of the different classes with three representative examples of individual galaxies.
- In spite of the different evolutionary histories, the bars are remarkably similar in strength, length, and formation times.
- The gas fraction in the baryonic component within two stellar half-mass radii at the time of bar formation is always below 0.4 and usually very low, which confirms in the cosmological context the validity of this threshold, which has previously been identified in controlled simulations.
- Observational counterparts of these objects can be found among early-type fast rotators, S0 galaxies, or red spirals with bars.

##### [A new approach for the statistical denoising of Planck interstellar dust polarization data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03160) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03160.pdf)

- Dust emission is the main foreground to Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization.
- Its statistical characterization must be derived from the analysis of observational data because the precision required for a reliable component separation is far greater than currently achievable with physical models of the turbulent magnetized interstellar medium.
- This letter takes a significant step towards this goal by proposing a method that retrieves non-Gaussian statistical characteristics of dust emission from noisy Planck polarization observations at 353 GHz.
- We devise a statistical denoising method based on the Wavelet Phase Harmonics (WPH) statistics, which characterize the coherent structures in non-Gaussian random fields and define a generative model of the data.
- The method is validated on mock data combining a dust map from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation and Planck noise maps.
- The denoised map reproduces the true power spectrum down to scales where the noise power is an order of magnitude larger than that of the signal.
- It remains highly correlated to the true emission and retrieves some of its non-Gaussian properties.
- Applied to Planck data, the method provides a new approach towards building a generative model of dust polarization that will characterize the full complexity of the dust emission.

- We estimate the strength and structure of the fields in the starburst galaxy M82 using thermal polarized emission observations from SOFIA/HAWC+ and a potential field extrapolation.
- We modified the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method to account for the large-scale flow and the turbulent field.
- Results show that the observed magnetic fields arise from the combination of a large-scale ordered potential field associated with the outflow and a small-scale turbulent field associated with bow-shock-like features.
- Within the central $900$pc radius, the potential field accounts for $53\pm4$% of the observed turbulent magnetic energy with a median field strength of $305\pm15$$\mu$G, while small-scale turbulent magnetic fields account for the remaining $40\pm5$% with a median field strength of $222\pm19$$\mu$G.
- We estimate that the turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energies are in close equipartition up to $\sim2$kpc (measured), while the turbulent kinetic energy dominates at $\sim7$kpc (extrapolated).
- We conclude that the fields are frozen into the ionized outflowing medium and driven away kinetically.
- This indicates that the magnetic field lines in the galactic wind of M82 are 'open,' providing a direct channel between the starburst core and the intergalactic medium.
- Our novel approach offers the tools needed to quantify the effects of outflows on galactic magnetic fields as well as their influence on the intergalactic medium and evolution of energetic particles.

##### [Evidence for r-process delay in very metal-poor stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03368) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03368.pdf)

- Currently, various types of astrophysical sites including neutron star mergers, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, are suggested as the origin of r-process elements.
	- The time delay between the star formation and the production of r-process elements is the key to distinguish these scenarios with the caveat that the diffusion of r-process elements in the interstellar medium also induces the delay in r-process enrichment because r-process events are rare.
- Here we study the observed Ba abundance data of very metal-poor stars as the tracer of the early enrichment history of r-process elements.
	- We find that the gradual increase of [Ba/Mg] with [Fe/H] requires a significant time delay (100 Myr -- 1 Gyr) of r-process events from star formation rather than the diffusion-induced delay.

##### [The origin of metal-poor stars on prograde disk orbits in FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03369) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03369.pdf)

- In hierarchical structure formation, metal-poor stars in and around the Milky Way (MW) originate primarily from mergers of lower-mass galaxies.
- A common expectation is therefore that metal-poor stars should have isotropic, dispersion-dominated orbits that do not correlate strongly with the MW disk.
- However, recent observations of stars in the MW show that metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2) stars are preferentially on prograde orbits with respect to the disk.
- Using the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW/M31-mass galaxies, we investigate the prevalence and origin of prograde metal-poor stars.
- Almost all (11 of 12) of our simulations have metal-poor stars preferentially on prograde orbits today and throughout most of their history: we thus predict that this is a generic feature of MW/M31-mass galaxies.
- The typical prograde-to-retrograde ratio is ~ 2:1, which depends weakly on stellar metallicity at [Fe/H] < -1.
- These trends predicted by our simulations agree well with MW observations.
- Prograde metal-poor stars originate largely from a single LMC/SMC-mass gas-rich galaxy merger, typically 7-12.5 Gyr ago, which deposited both existing metal-poor stars and significant gas on an orbital vector that sparked the formation of and/or shaped the orientation of a long-lived stellar disk, giving rise to a prograde bias for all low-metallicity stars.
- We also find sub-dominant contributions from in-situ stars formed in the host galaxy before this merger, and in some cases, additional massive mergers.
- We find few clear correlations between any properties of our MW/M31-mass galaxies at z=0 and the degree of this prograde bias as a result of diverse merger scenarios.

- We compare the radial profiles of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) in a sample of 169 star-forming galaxies in close pairs with those of mass-matched control galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey.
- We find that the sSFR is centrally enhanced (within one effective radius) in interacting galaxies by ~0.3 dex and that there is a weak sSFR suppression in the outskirts of the galaxies of ~0.1 dex.
- We stack the differences profiles for galaxies in five stellar mass bins between log(M/Mstar) = 9.0-11.5 and find that the sSFR enhancement has no dependence on the stellar mass.
- The same result is obtained when the comparison galaxies are matched to each paired galaxy in both stellar mass and redshift.
- In addition, we find that that the sSFR enhancement is elevated in pairs with nearly equal masses and closer projected separations, in agreement with previous work based on single-fiber spectroscopy.
- We also find that the sSFR offsets in the outskirts of the paired galaxies are dependent on whether the galaxy is the more massive or less massive companion in the pair.
- The more massive companion experiences zero to a positive sSFR enhancement while the less massive companion experiences sSFR suppression in their outskirts.
- Our results illustrate the complex tidal effects on star formation in closely paired galaxies.


##### [Wandering of the central black hole in a galactic nucleus and correlation of the black hole mass with the bulge mass](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03478) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03478.pdf)

- We investigate a mechanism for a super-massive black hole at the center of a galaxy to wander in the nucleus region.
- A situation is supposed in which the central black hole tends to move by the gravitational attractions from the nearby molecular clouds in a nuclear bulge but is braked via the dynamical frictions by the ambient stars there.
- We estimate the approximate kinetic energy of the black hole in an equilibrium between the energy gain rate through the gravitational attractions and the energy loss rate through the dynamical frictions, in a nuclear bulge composed of a nuclear stellar disk and a nuclear stellar cluster as observed from our Galaxy.
- The wandering distance of the black hole in the gravitational potential of the nuclear bulge is evaluated to get as large as several 10 pc, when the black hole mass is relatively small.
- The distance, however, shrinks as the black hole mass increases and the equilibrium solution between the energy gain and loss disappears when the black hole mass exceeds an upper limit.
- As a result, we can expect the following scenario for the evolution of the black hole mass: When the black hole mass is smaller than the upper limit, mass accretion of the interstellar matter in the circum-nuclear region, causing the AGN activities, makes the black hole mass larger.
- However, when the mass gets to the upper limit, the black hole loses the balancing force against the dynamical friction and starts spiraling downward to the gravity center.
- From simple parameter scaling, the upper mass limit of the black hole is found to be proportional to the bulge mass and this could explain the observed correlation of the black hole mass with the bulge mass.

##### [Halo shapes constrained from a pure sample of central galaxies in KiDS-1000](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03549) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03549.pdf)

- We present measurements of $f_h$, the ratio of the aligned components of the projected halo and galaxy ellipticities, for a sample of central galaxies using weak gravitational lensing data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS).
- Using a lens galaxy shape estimation that is more sensitive to outer galaxy regions, we find $f_{\rm h}=0.50\pm0.20$for our full sample and $f_{\rm h}=0.55\pm0.19$for an intrinsically red (and therefore higher stellar-mass) sub-sample, rejecting the hypothesis of round halos and/or galaxies being un-aligned with their parent halo at $2.5\sigma$and $2.9\sigma$, respectively.
- We quantify the 93.4% purity of our central galaxy sample using numerical simulations and overlapping spectroscopy from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey.
- This purity ensures that the interpretation of our measurements is not complicated by the presence of a significant fraction of satellite galaxies.
- Restricting our central galaxy ellipticity measurement to the inner isophotes, we find $f_{\rm h}=0.34\pm0.17$for our red sub-sample, suggesting that the outer galaxy regions are more aligned with their dark matter halos compared to the inner regions.
- Our results are in agreement with previous studies and suggest that lower mass halos are rounder and/or less aligned with their host galaxy than samples of more massive galaxies, studied in galaxy groups and clusters.

##### [CNN Architecture Comparison for Radio Galaxy Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03780) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03780.pdf)

- The morphological classification of radio sources is important to gain a full understanding of galaxy evolution processes and their relation with local environmental properties.
- Furthermore, the complex nature of the problem, its appeal for citizen scientists and the large data rates generated by existing and upcoming radio telescopes combine to make the morphological classification of radio sources an ideal test case for the application of machine learning techniques.
- One approach that has shown great promise recently is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Literature, however, lacks two major things when it comes to CNNs and radio galaxy morphological classification.
- Firstly, a proper analysis of whether overfitting occurs when training CNNs to perform radio galaxy morphological classification using a small curated training set is needed.
- Secondly, a good comparative study regarding the practical applicability of the CNN architectures in literature is required.
- Both of these shortcomings are addressed in this paper.
- Multiple performance metrics are used for the latter comparative study, such as inference time, model complexity, computational complexity and mean per class accuracy.
- As part of this study we also investigate the effect that receptive field, stride length and coverage has on recognition performance.
- For the sake of completeness, we also investigate the recognition performance gains that we can obtain by employing classification ensembles.
- A ranking system based upon recognition and computational performance is proposed.
- MCRGNet, Radio Galaxy Zoo and ConvXpress (novel classifier) are the architectures that best balance computational requirements with recognition performance.

##### [A direct and robust method to observationally constrain the halo mass function via the submillimeter magnification bias: Proof of concept](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03890) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03890.pdf)

- The main purpose of this work is to provide a method to derive tabulated observational constraints on the halo mass function (HMF) by studying the magnification bias effect on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies.
- Under the assumption of universality, we parametrize the HMF according to two traditional models, namely the Sheth and Tormen (ST) and Tinker fits and assess their performance in explaining the measured data within the {\Lambda} cold dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model.
- We also study the potential influence of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters in this analysis and discuss two important aspects regarding the HMF parametrization.
- Methods.
- We measure the cross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA galaxies with redshifts in the range $0.2<z<0.8$and a background sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with redshifts in the range $1.2<z<4.0$and carry out an MCMC algorithm to check this observable against its mathematical prediction within the halo model formalism.
- Results.
- If all HMF parameters are assumed to be positive, the ST fit only seems to fully explain the measurements by forcing the mean number of satellite galaxies in a halo to increase substantially from its prior mean value.
- The Tinker fit, on the other hand, provides a robust description of the data without relevant changes in the HOD parameters, but with some dependence on the prior range of two of its parameters.
- When the normalization condition for the HMF is dropped and we allow negative values of the $p_1$parameter in the ST fit, all the involved parameters are better determined, unlike the previous models, thus deriving the most general HMF constraints.
- While all cases are in agreement with the traditional fits within the uncertainties, the last one hints at a slightly higher number of halos at intermediate and high masses, raising the important point of the allowed parameter range.

##### [The physical properties of local (U)LIRGs: a comparison with nearby early- and late-type galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03913) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03913.pdf)

- In order to pinpoint the place of the (U)LIRGs in the local Universe we examine the properties of a sample of 67 such systems and compare them with those of 268 ETGs and 542 LTGs from the DustPedia database.
- We make use of multi-wavelength photometric data and the CIGALE SED fitting code to extract their physical parameters.
- The median SEDs as well as the values of the derived parameters were compared to those of the local ETGs and LTGs.
- In addition to that, (U)LIRGs were divided into seven classes, according to the merging stage of each system, and variations in the derived parameters were investigated.
- (U)LIRGs occupy the 'high-end' on the dust and stellar mass, and SFR in the local Universe with median values of 5.2$\times10^7~M_{\odot}$, 6.3$\times10^{10}~M_{\odot}$and 52$~M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, respectively.
- The PDR-dust emission in (U)LIRGs is 11.7% of the total dust luminosity, significantly higher than ETGs (1.6%) and the LTGs (5.2%).
- The median value of the dust temperature in (U)LIRGs is 32 K, which is higher compared to both the ETGs (28 K) and the LTGs (22 K).
- Small differences, in the derived parameters, are seen for the seven merging classes of our sample of (U)LIRGs with the most evident one being on the star-formation rate, where in systems in late merging stages the median SFR reaches up to 99 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$compared to 26 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$for the isolated ones.
- In contrast to the local normal galaxies where old stars dominate the stellar emission, the young stars in (U)LIRGs contribute with 64% of their luminosity to the total stellar luminosity.
- The fraction of the dust-absorbed stellar luminosity is extremely high in (U)LIRGs (78%) compared to 7% and 25% in ETGs and ETGs, respectively.
- The fraction of the stellar luminosity used to heat up the dust grains is very high in (U)LIRGs, while 74% of the dust emission comes from the young stars.

##### [Galaxy Lookback Evolution Models - a Comparison with Magneticum Cosmological Simulations and Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04135) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04135.pdf)

- We construct empirical models of star-forming galaxy evolution assuming that individual galaxies evolve along well-known scaling relations between stellar mass, gas mass and star formation rate following a simple description of chemical evolution.
- We test these models by a comparison with observations and with detailed Magneticum high resolution hydrodynamic cosmological simulations.
- Galaxy star formation rates, stellar masses, gas masses, ages, interstellar medium and stellar metallicities are compared.
- It is found that these simple lookback models capture many of the crucial aspects of galaxy evolution reasonably well.
- Their key assumption of a redshift dependent power law relationship between galaxy interstellar medium gas mass and stellar mass is in agreement with the outcome of the complex Magneticum simulations.
- Star formation rates decline towards lower redshift not because galaxies are running out of gas, but because the fraction of the cold ISM gas, which is capable of producing stars, becomes significantly smaller.
- Gas accretion rates in both model approaches are of the same order of magnitude.
- Metallicity in the Magneticum simulations increases with the ratio of stellar mass to gas mass as predicted by the lookback models.
- The mass metallicity relationships agree and the star formation rate dependence of these relationships is also reproduced.
- We conclude that these simple models provide a powerful tool for constraining and interpreting more complex models based on cosmological simulations and for population synthesis studies analyzing integrated spectra of stellar populations.

- We investigate how different galaxy properties - luminosities in u, g, r, J, K-bands, stellar mass, star formation rate and specific star formation rate trace the environment in the local universe.
- We also study the effect of survey flux limits on galaxy clustering measurements.
- We measure the two-point correlation function (2pCF) and marked correlation functions (MCFs) using the aforementioned properties as marks.
- We use nearly stellar-mass-complete galaxy sample in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.16 from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey with a flux limit of r < 19.8.
- Further, we impose a brighter flux limit of r < 17.8 to our sample and repeat the measurements to study how this affects galaxy clustering analysis.
- We compare our results to measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with flux limits of r < 17.8 and r < 16.8.
- We show that the stellar mass is the best tracer of galaxy environment, the K-band luminosity being a good substitute, although such a proxy sample misses close pairs of evolved, red galaxies.
- We also confirm that the u-band luminosity is a good, but not a perfect proxy of star formation rate in the context of galaxy clustering.
- We observe an effect of the survey flux limit on clustering studies - samples with a higher flux limit (smaller magnitude) miss some information about close pairs of starburst galaxies.

##### [Stellar Dynamical Modeling - Accuracy of 3D Density Estimation for Edge-on Axisymmetric Galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04189) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04189.pdf)

- From Rybicki's analysis using the Fourier slice theorem, mathematically it is possible to reproduce uniquely an edge-on axisymmetric galaxy's 3D light distribution from its 2D surface brightness.
- Utilizing galaxies from a cosmological simulation, we examine the ability of Syer and Tremaine's made-to-measure method and Schwarzschild's method for stellar dynamical modeling to do so for edge-on oblate axisymmetric galaxies.
- Overall, we find that the methods do not accurately recover the 3D distributions, with the made-to-measure method producing more accurate estimates than Schwarzschild's method.
- Our results have implications broader than just luminosity density, and affect other luminosity-weighted distributions within galaxies, for example, age and metallicity.

##### [Simulating the transport of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields injected by radio galaxies in the intracluster medium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04193) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04193.pdf)

- Radio galaxies play an important role in the seeding of cosmic rays and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.
- Here, we simulate the evolution of relativistic electrons injected into the intracluster medium by radio galaxies.
- Using passive tracer particles added to magnetohydrodynamical adaptive-mesh simulations, we calculate the evolution of the spectrum of relativistic electrons taking into account energy losses and re-acceleration mechanisms associated with the dymamics of the intracluster medium.
- Re-acceleration can occur at shocks via diffusive shock acceleration, and in turbulent flows via second-order Fermi re-acceleration.
- Relativistic electrons from radio galaxies are found to fill the intracluster medium over scales of several $100 \rm ~Myr$, and they create a stable reservoir of fossil electrons which remains available for further re-acceleration by shock waves and turbulent gas motions.
- In the near future, deep radio observations (especially at low frequencies) are likely to probe such mechanisms in galaxy clusters.

##### [An Unbiased Estimator of the Full-sky CMB Angular Power Spectrum using Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04327) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04327.pdf)

- Accurate estimation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) angular power spectrum is enticing due to the prospect for precision cosmology it presents.
- Galactic foreground emissions, however, contaminate the CMB signal and need to be subtracted reliably in order to lessen systematic errors on the CMB temperature estimates.
- Typically bright foregrounds in a region lead to further uncertainty in temperature estimates in the area even after some foreground removal technique is performed and hence determining the underlying full-sky angular power spectrum poses a challenge.
- We explore the feasibility of utilizing artificial neural networks to predict the angular power spectrum of the full sky CMB temperature maps from the observed angular power spectrum of the partial sky in which CMB temperatures in some bright foreground regions are masked.
- We present our analysis at large angular scales with two different masks.
- We produce unbiased predictions of the full-sky angular power spectrum and the underlying theoretical power spectrum using neural networks.
- Our predictions are also uncorrelated to a large extent.
- We further show that the multipole-multipole covariances of the predictions of the full-sky spectra made by the ANNs are much smaller than those of the estimates obtained using the method of pseudo-$C_l$.

- We study the bar instability in collisionless, rotating, anisotropic, stellar systems, using N-body simulations and also the matrix technique for calculation of modes with the perturbed collisionless Boltzmann equation.
- These methods are applied to spherical systems with an initial Plummer density distribution, but modified kinematically in two ways: the velocity distribution is tangentially anisotropic, using results of Dejonghe, and the system is set in rotation by reversing the velocities of a fraction of stars in various regions of phase space, a la Lynden-Bell.
- The aim of the N-body simulations is first to survey the parameter space, and, using those results, to identify regions of phase space (by radius and orbital inclination) which have the most important influence on the bar instability.
- The matrix method is then used to identify the resonant interactions in the system which have the greatest effect on the growth rate of a bar.
- Complementary series of N-body simulations examine these processes in relation to the evolving frequency distribution and the pattern speed.
- Finally, the results are synthesised with an existing theoretical framework, and used to consider the old question of constructing a stability criterion.

- In this study, we use the SWIFT/BAT AGN sample, which has received extensive multiwavelength follow-up analysis as a result of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), to develop a diagnostic for nuclear obscuration by examining the relationship between the line-of-sight column densities ($N_{\rm{H}}$), the 2-10 keV-to-$12 \rm{\mu m}$luminosity ratio, and WISE mid-infrared colors.
- We demonstrate that heavily obscured AGNs tend to exhibit both preferentially ''redder'' mid-infrared colors and lower values of $L_{\rm{X, Obs.
- }}$/$L_{12 \rm{\mu m}}$than less obscured AGNs, and we derive expressions relating $N_{\rm{H}}$to the $L_{\rm{X, Obs.
- }}$/$L_{12 \rm{\mu m}}$and $L_{22 \rm{\mu m}}$/$L_{4.6 \rm{\mu m}}$luminosity ratios as well as develop diagnostic criteria using these ratios.
- Our diagnostic regions yield samples that are $\gtrsim80$% complete and $\gtrsim60$% pure for AGNs with log($N_{\rm{H}})\geq24$, as well as $\gtrsim85$% pure for AGNs with $\rm{log}(N_{\rm{H}})\gtrsim23.5$.
- We find that these diagnostics cannot be used to differentiate between optically star forming galaxies and active galaxies.
- Further, mid-IR contributions from host galaxies that dominate the observed $12~\rm{\mu m}$emission can lead to larger apparent X-ray deficits and redder mid-IR colors than the AGNs would intrinsically exhibit, though this effect helps to better separate less obscured and more obscured AGNs.
- Finally, we test our diagnostics on two catalogs of AGNs and infrared galaxies, including the XMM-Newton XXL-N field, and we identify several known Compton-thick AGNs as well as a handful of candidate heavily obscured AGNs based upon our proposed obscuration diagnostics.

- We study the innermost jet morphology and magnetic field strength in the AGN 3C 345 with an unprecedented resolution using images obtained within the framework of the key science programme on AGN polarisation of the Space VLBI mission RadioAstron.
- Methods.
- We observed the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 345 at 1.6 GHz on 2016 March 30 with RadioAstron and 18 ground-based radio telescopes in full polarisation mode.
- Results.
- Our images, in both total intensity and linear polarisation, reveal a complex jet structure at 300 $\mu$as angular resolution, corresponding to a projected linear scale of about 2 pc or a few thousand gravitational radii.
- We identify the synchrotron self-absorbed core at the jet base and find the brightest feature in the jet 1.5 mas downstream of the core.
- Several polarised components appear in the Space VLBI images that cannot be seen from ground array-only images.
- Except for the core, the electric vector position angles follow the local jet direction, suggesting a magnetic field perpendicular to the jet.
- This indicates the presence of plane perpendicular shocks in these regions.
- Additionally, we infer a minimum brightness temperature at the largest $(u,v)$-distances of $1.1\times 10^{12}$K in the source frame, which is above the inverse Compton limit and an order of magnitude larger than the equipartition value.
- This indicates locally efficient injection or re-acceleration of particles in the jet to counter the inverse Compton cooling or the geometry of the jet creates significant changes in the Doppler factor, which has to be $>11$to explain the high brightness temperatures.

- Here we show that reflection of sunlight from a high-orbit satellite or a piece of space debris is a valid and reasonable explanation.

- The past decade has seen impressive progress in the detection of $z>7$galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope, however little is known about their properties.
- The James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionise the high-$z$field by providing NIR (i.e, rest-frame optical) data of unprecedented depth and spatial resolution.
- Measuring galaxy quantities such as resolved stellar ages or gas metallicity gradients traditionally requires spectroscopy, as broad-band imaging filters are generally too coarse to fully isolate diagnostics such as the 4000 \r{A} (rest-frame) break, continuum emission from aged stars, and key emission lines (e.g., [OII], [OIII], H$\beta$).
- However, in this paper, we show that adding NIRCam images through a strategically chosen medium-band filter to common wide-band filters sets adopted by ERS and GTO programs delivers tighter constraints on these galactic properties.
- To constrain the choice of filter, we perform a systematic investigation of which combinations of wide-band filters from ERS and GTO programs and single medium-band filters offer the tightest constraints on several galaxy properties at redshifts $z\sim7-11$.
- We employ the JAGUAR extragalactic catalogs to construct statistical samples of physically-motivated mock photometry and conduct SED-fitting procedures to evaluate the accuracy of galaxy property (and photo-$z$) recovery with a simple star-formation history model.
- We find that adding $>4.1 \mu$m medium filters at comparable depth to the broad-band filters can significantly improve photo-$z$s and yield close to order-of-magnitude improvements in the determination of quantities such as stellar ages, metallicities, SF-related quantities and emission line fluxes at $z\sim8$.
- For resolved sources, the proposed approach enables spatially-resolved determination of these quantities that would be prohibitive with slit spectroscopy.

##### [The first measurement of the quasar lifetime distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04477) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04477.pdf)

- Understanding the growth of the supermassive black holes powering luminous quasars, their co-evolution with host galaxies, and impact on the surrounding intergalactic medium depends sensitively on the duration of quasar accretion episodes.
- Unfortunately, this time-scale, known as the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$, is still uncertain by orders of magnitude ($t_{\rm Q}\simeq 0.01~{\rm Myr}-1~{\rm Gyr}$).
- However, the extent of the He II Ly$\alpha$proximity zones in the absorption spectra of $z_{\rm qso}\sim3-4$quasars constitutes a unique probe, providing sensitivity to lifetimes up to $\sim 30$Myr.
- Our recent analysis of $22$archival He II proximity zone spectra reveals a surprisingly broad range of emission timescales, indicating that some quasars turned on $\lesssim 1$Myr ago, whereas others have been shining for $\gtrsim 30$Myr.
- Determining the underlying quasar lifetime distribution (QLD) from proximity zone measurements is a challenging task owing to: 1) the limited sensitivity of individual measurements; 2) random sampling of the quasar light curves; 3) density fluctuations in the quasar environment; and 4) the inhomogeneous ionization state of He II in a reionizing IGM.
- We combine a semi-numerical He II reionization model, hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with ionizing radiative transfer, and a novel statistical framework to infer the QLD from an ensemble of proximity zone measurements.
- Assuming a log-normal QLD, we infer a mean $\langle {\rm log}_{10}\left(t_{\rm Q}/{\rm Myr}\right)\rangle=0.22^{+0.22}_{-0.25}$and standard deviation $\sigma_{{\rm log}_{10}t_{\rm Q}}=0.80^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$.
- Our results allow us to estimate the probability of detecting young quasars with $t_{\rm Q}\leq0.1$Myr from their proximity zone sizes yielding $p\left(\leq 0.1~{\rm Myr}\right)=0.19^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$, which is broadly consistent with recent determination at $z\sim 6$.

##### [The Age of the Universe with Globular Clusters: Reducing Systematic Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04486) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04486.pdf)

- The dominant systematic uncertainty in the age determination of galactic globular clusters is the depth of the convection envelope of the stars.
- This parameter is partially degenerate with metallicity which is in turn degenerate with age.
- However, if the metal content, distance and extinction are known, the position and morphology of the red giant branch in a color-magnitude diagram are mostly sensitive to the value of the depth of the convective envelope.
- Therefore, using external, precise metallicity determinations this degeneracy and thus the systematic error in age, can be reduced.
- Alternatively, the morphology of the red giant branch of globular clusters color magnitude diagram can also be used to achieve the same.
- We demonstrate that globular cluster red giant branches are well fitted by values of the depth of the convection envelope consistent with those obtained for the Sun and this finding is robust to the adopted treatment of the stellar physics.
- With these findings, the uncertainty in the depth of the convection envelope is no longer the dominant contribution to the systematic error in the age determination of the oldest globular clusters, reducing it from $0.5$to $0.23$or $0.33$Gyr, depending on the methodology adopted: i.e, whether resorting to external data (spectroscopic metallicity determinations) or relying solely on the morphology of the clusters's color-magnitude diagrams.
- This results in an age of the Universe $t_{\rm U}=13.5^{+0.16}_{-0.14} {\rm (stat.)}
- \pm 0.23(0.33) ({\rm sys.
- })$at 68\% confidence level, accounting for the formation time of globular clusters and its uncertainty.
- An uncertainty of 0.27(0.36) Gyr if added in quadrature.
- This agrees well with $13.8 \pm 0.02$Gyr, the cosmological model-dependent value inferred by the Planck mission assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.

- The LMC and Sgr stars, in the considered metallicity range ([Fe/H]>-1.1 dex), show very similar abundance ratios for almost all the elements, with differences only in the heavy s-process elements Ba, La and Nd, suggesting a different contribution by asymptotic giant branch stars.
- On the other hand, the two galaxies have chemical patterns clearly different from those measured in the Galactic stars, especially for the elements produced by massive stars.

##### [On the variation in stellar alpha-enhancements of star-forming galaxies in the EAGLE simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04561) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04561.pdf)

- The ratio of $\alpha$-elements to iron in galaxies holds valuable information about the star-formation history since their enrichment occurs on different timescales.
- The fossil record of stars in galaxies has mostly been excavated for passive galaxies, since the light of star-forming galaxies is dominated by young stars which have much weaker atmospheric absorption features.
- Here we use the cosmological EAGLE simulation to investigate the origin of variations in $\alpha$-enhancement among star-forming galaxies at $z=0$.
- The definition of $\alpha$-enhancement in a composite stellar population is ambiguous.
- We elucidate two definitions - termed 'mean' and 'galactic' $\alpha$-enhancement - in more detail.
- While a star-forming galaxy has a high 'mean' $\alpha$-enhancement when its stars formed rapidly, a galaxy with a large 'galactic' $\alpha$-enhancement generally had a delayed star formation history.
- We find that absorption-line strengths of Mg and Fe correlate with variations in $\alpha$-enhancement.
- These correlations are strongest for the 'galactic' $\alpha$-enhancement.
- However, we show that these are mostly caused by other effects which are cross-correlated with $\alpha$-enhancement, such as variations in the light-weighted age.
- This severely complicates the retrieval of $\alpha$-enhancements in star-forming galaxies.
- The ambiguity is not severe for passive galaxies and we confirm that spectral variations in these galaxies are caused by measurable variations in $\alpha$-enhancements.
- We suggest that this more complex coupling between $\alpha$-enhancement and star formation histories can guide the interpretation of new observations of star-forming galaxies.

##### [Resolved HI in two ultra-diffuse galaxies from contrasting non-cluster environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04564) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04564.pdf)

- We report on the first resolved HI observations of two blue ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs)using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).
- The targets are from contrasting non-cluster environments: UDG-B1 is projected in the outskirts of Hickson Compact Group 25 and Secco-dI-2 (SdI-2) is an isolated UDG.
- These UDGs also have contrasting effective radii with Re of 3.7 kpc (similar to the Milky Way) and 1.3 kpc respectively.
- SdI-2 has an unusually large MHI/M* ratio =28.9, confirming a previous single dish HI observation.
- Both galaxies display HI morphological and kinematic signatures consistent with a recent tidal interaction, which is also supported by observations from other wavelengths, including optical spectroscopy.
- Within the limits of the observations' resolution, our analysis indicates that SdI-2 is dark matter-dominated within its HI radius and this is also likely to be the case for UDG-B1.
- Our study highlights the importance of high spatial and spectral resolution HI observations for the study of the dark matter properties of UDGs.

##### [Microinstabilities in the Transition Region of Weak Quasi-Perpendicular Intracluster Shocks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04569) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04569.pdf)

- Microinstabilities play important roles in both entropy generation and particle acceleration in collisionless shocks.
- Recent studies have suggested that in the transition zone of quasi-perpendicular ($Q_{\perp}$) shocks in the high-beta ($\beta=P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B}$) intracluster medium (ICM), the ion temperature anisotropy due to the reflected-gyrating ions could trigger the Alfv\'en ion cyclotron (AIC) instability and the ion-mirror instability, while the electron temperature anisotropy induced by magnetic field compression could excite the whistler instability and the electron-mirror instability.
- Adopting the numerical estimates for ion and electron temperature anisotropies found in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of $Q_{\perp}$-shocks with sonic Mach numbers, $M_{\rm s}=2-3$, we carry out a linear stability analysis for these microinstabilities.
- The kinetic properties of the microinstabilities and the ensuing plasma waves on both ion and electron scales are described for wide ranges of parameters, including the dependence on $\beta$and the ion-to-electron mass ratio.
- In addition, the nonlinear evolution of induced plasma waves are examined by performing 2D PIC simulations with periodic boundary conditions.
- We find that for $\beta\approx 20-100$, the AIC instability could induce ion-scale waves and generate shock surface ripples in supercritical shocks above the AIC critical Mach number, $M_{\rm AIC}^{*} \approx 2.3$.
- Also electron-scale waves are generated primarily by the whistler instability in these high-$\beta$shocks.
- The resulting multi-scale waves from electron to ion scales are thought to be essential in electron injection to the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism in $Q_{\perp}$-shocks in the ICM.

##### [How does the Polar Dust affect the Correlation between Dust Covering Factor and Eddington Ratio in Type 1 Quasars Selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04620) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04620.pdf)

- We revisit the dependence of covering factor (CF) of dust torus on physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by taking into account an AGN polar dust emission.
- The CF is converted from a ratio of infrared (IR) luminosity contributed from AGN dust torus ($L_{\rm IR}^{\rm torus}$) and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$), by assuming a non-linear relation between luminosity ratio and intrinsic CF.
- We select 37,181 type 1 quasars at $z < 0.7$from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasar catalog.
- Their $L_{\rm bol}$, black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) are derived by spectral fitting with QSFit.
- We conduct spectral energy distribution decomposition by using X-CIGALE with clumpy torus and polar dust model to estimate $L_{\rm IR}^{\rm torus}$without being affected by the contribution of stellar and AGN polar dust to IR emission.
- For 5720 quasars whose physical quantities are securely determined, we perform a correlation analysis on CF and (i) $L_{\rm bol}$, (ii) $M_{\rm BH}$, and (iii) $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$.
- As a result, anti-correlations for CF-$L_{\rm bol}$, CF-$M_{\rm BH}$, and CF-$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$are confirmed.
- We find that incorporating the AGN polar dust emission makes those anti-correlations stronger which are compared to those without considering it.
- This indicates that polar dust wind provably driven by AGN radiative pressure is one of the key components to regulate obscuring material of AGNs.

##### [A detailed study of X-ray cavities in the intracluster environment of the cool core cluster Abell~3017](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04650) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04650.pdf)

- We present a detailed analysis of a cool-core galaxy cluster Abell~3017, at a redshift of $z\!=\!
- 0.219$, which has been identified to be merging with its companion cluster Abell~3016.
- This study has made use of X-ray ({\it Chandra}), UV (GALEX), optical (ESO/VLT), mid-infrared (WISE), and radio uGMRT observations of this cluster.
- Using various image processing techniques, such as unsharp masking, 2-d fits using Beta models, contour binning and the use of surface brightness profiles, we show the existence of a pair of X-ray cavities, at a projected distance of ~$\sim$20\arcsec (70 kpc) and ~$\sim$16\arcsec (57 kpc), respectively from the core of Abell~3017.
- We also detect an excess of X-ray emission, relatively hotter than that of the surroundings, towards the south, at $\sim$25\arcsec (88 kpc) from the core of the cluster, indicating the existence of an in-falling galaxy group.
- We find that the radio lobes are responsible for the observed X-ray cavities detected in this system.
- The lower values of mid-IR WISE color [W1-W2] and [W2-W3] imply that the central BCG of Abell~3017 is a star-forming galaxy.
- The current star formation rate of the central BCG, estimated from the ${\rm H\alpha}$and {\it GALEX} FUV luminosities, are equal to be $\sim 5.06\pm 0.78$\Msun yr$^{-1}$and $\sim 9.20\pm 0.81$\Msun yr$^{-1}$, respectively.
- We detect, for the first time, a radio phoenix $\sim$150 kpc away from the radio core, with a spectral index of ($\alpha \!\leq\!
- -1.8$).
- We also report the detection of $\rm~Pa_\alpha$emission in this cluster using ESO VLT {\tt SINFONI} imaging data.

- We model the near infrared SED of NGC 4151 with a 3-D radiative transfer SKIRT code, using which torus only (TO) and Ring And Torus (RAT) scenarios are studied.
	- All the models are able to explain the flat NIR SED of NGC 4151 with minor differences in the derived parameters.
	- The $R_{\rm in, t}$from the TO model does not agree with the NIR observations ($\sim 0.04$pc).
- Hence, the most likely scenario is that a hot graphite ring is located at a distance 0.04 pc from the centre, composed of a smooth distribution of dust followed by a dusty torus at 0.1 pc with ISM type of grains.

- We present the joint analysis of Neutral Hydrogen (HI) Intensity Mapping observations with three galaxy samples: the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples from the eBOSS survey, and the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey sample.
- The HI intensity maps are Green Bank Telescope observations of the redshifted 21cm emission on 100deg2 covering the redshift range $0.6<z<1.0$.
- We process the data by separating and removing the foregrounds with FastICA, and construct a transfer function to correct for the effects of foreground removal on the HI signal.
- We cross-correlate the cleaned HI data with the galaxy samples and study the overall amplitude as well as the scale-dependence of the power spectrum.
- We also qualitatively compare our findings with the predictions by a semi-analytic galaxy evolution simulation.
- The cross-correlations constrain the quantity $\Omega_{{HI}} b_{{HI}} r_{{HI},{opt}}$at an effective scale $k_{eff}$, where $\Omega_{HI}$is the HI density fraction, $b_{HI}$is the HI bias, and $r_{{HI},{opt}}$the galaxy-hydrogen correlation coefficient, which is dependent on the HI content of the optical galaxy sample.
- At $k_{eff}=0.31 h/{Mpc}$we find $\Omega_{{HI}} b_{{HI}} r_{{HI},{Wig}} = [0.58 \pm 0.09 {(stat) \pm 0.05 {(sys)}}] \times 10^{-3}$for GBT-WiggleZ, $\Omega_{{HI}} b_{{HI}} r_{{HI,{ELG}}} = [0.40 \pm 0.09 {(stat) \pm 0.04 {(sys)}}] \times 10^{-3}$for GBT-ELG, and $\Omega_{{HI}} b_{{HI}} r_{{HI},{LRG}} = [0.35 \pm 0.08 {(stat) \pm 0.03 {(sys)}}] \times 10^{-3}$for GBT-LRG, at $z\simeq 0.8$.
- We also report results at $k_{eff}=0.24 h/{Mpc}$and $k_{eff}=0.48 h/{Mpc}$.
- With little information on HI parameters beyond our local Universe, these are amongst the most precise constraints on neutral hydrogen density fluctuations in an underexplored redshift range.

##### [How Many Elements Matter?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04992) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04992.pdf)

- Some studies of stars' multi-element abundance distributions suggest at least 5-7 significant dimensions, but other studies show that the abundances of many elements can be predicted to high accuracy from [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] alone (or from [Fe/H] and age).
- We show that both propositions can be, and are, simultaneously true.
- We adopt a technique known as normalizing flow to reconstruct the probability distribution of Milky Way disk stars in the space of 15 elemental abundances measured by APOGEE.
- Conditioning on stellar parameters $T_{\rm eff}$and $\log g$minimizes the differential systematics.
- After conditioning on [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], the residual scatter for the best measured APOGEE elements is $\sigma_{[X/{\rm H}]} \lesssim 0.02$dex, consistent with APOGEE's reported statistical uncertainties of $\sim 0.01 - 0.015$dex and intrinsic scatter of $0.01-0.02$dex.
- Despite the small scatter, residual abundances display clear correlations between elements, which are too large to be explained by measurement uncertainties or by the statistical noise from our finite sample size.
- We must condition on at least seven elements (e.g., Fe, Mg, O, Si, Ni, Ca, Al) to reduce residual correlations to a level consistent with observational uncertainties, and higher measurement precision for other elements would likely reveal additional dimensions.
- Our results demonstrate that cross-element correlations are a much more sensitive and robust probe of hidden structure than dispersion alone, and they can be measured precisely in a large sample even if star-by-star measurement noise is comparable to the intrinsic scatter.
- We conclude that many elements have an independent story to tell, even for a "mundane" sample of disk stars and elements produced mainly by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae.
- The only way to learn these lessons is to measure the abundances directly, and not merely infer them.

- We present component-separated maps of the primary cosmic microwave background/kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) amplitude and the thermal SZ Compton-$y$parameter, created using data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Planck satellite.
- These maps, which cover the $\sim$2500 square degrees of the Southern sky imaged by the SPT-SZ survey, represent a significant improvement over previous such products available in this region by virtue of their higher angular resolution (1.25 arcminutes for our highest resolution Compton-$y$maps) and lower noise at small angular scales.
- In this work we detail the construction of these maps using linear combination techniques, including our method for limiting the correlation of our lowest-noise Compton-$y$map products with the cosmic infrared background.
- We perform a range of validation tests on these data products to test our sky modeling and combination algorithms, and we find good performance in all of these tests.
- Recognizing the potential utility of these data products for a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological analyses, including studies of the gas properties of galaxies, groups, and clusters, we make these products publicly available at http://pole.uchicago.edu/public/data/sptsz_ymap and on the NASA/LAMBDA website.

- We find that the mass reconstruction by our multi-layered CNN with the architecture of alternating convolution and trans-convolution filters significantly outperforms the traditional reconstruction methods.
- The CNN method provides better pixel-to-pixel correlations with the truth, restores more accurate positions of the mass peaks, and more efficiently suppresses artifacts near the field edges.
- In addition, the CNN mass reconstruction lifts the mass-sheet degeneracy when applied to sufficiently large fields.

- #galaxy/cgm #galaxy/igm
- We report the discovery of diffuse extended Ly-alpha emission from redshift 3.1 to 4.5, tracing cosmic web filaments on scales of 2.5-4 comoving Mpc.
- These structures have been observed in overdensities of Ly-alpha emitters in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field
- Remarkably, 70% of the total Ly-alpha luminosity from these filaments comes from beyond the circumgalactic medium of any identified Ly-alpha emitters.
- Fluorescent Ly-alpha emission powered by the cosmic UV background can only account for less than 34% of this emission at z$\approx$3 and for not more than 10% at higher redshift.
- We find that the bulk of this diffuse emission can be reproduced by the unresolved Ly-alpha emission of a large population of ultra low luminosity Ly-alpha emitters ($\mathrm{<10^{40} erg s^{-1}}$), provided that the faint end of the Ly-alpha luminosity function is steep ($\alpha \lessapprox -1.8$), it extends down to luminosities lower than $\mathrm{10^{38} - 10^{37} erg s^{-1}}$and the clustering of these Ly-alpha emitters is significant (filling factor $< 1/6$).
- If these Ly-alpha emitters are powered by star formation, then this implies their luminosity function needs to extend down to star formation rates $\mathrm{< 10^{-4} M_\odot yr^{-1}}$.

- NGC1068的外流不是简单的 biconical outflows: finding a morphologically symmetric pair of approaching and receding gas blobs in the northeast region.
	- The midpoint of the two blobs is located at a distance of 180 pc from the nucleus in the projected plane.
- The ionized gas at the midpoint shows zero velocity and high velocity dispersion, which are characteristics of an outflow-launching position, as the two sides of a bicone, i.e, approaching and receding outflows are superposed on the line of sight, leading to no velocity shift but high velocity dispersion.
- While there are other possibilities, i.e, X-ray binary or supernova shock, the results from optical spectropolarimetry analysis are consistent with the presence of an additional AGN, which likely originates from a minor merger.

- #galaxy/quenching #galaxy/environment 
- Observations suggest that satellite quenching plays a major role in the build-up of passive, low-mass galaxies at late cosmic times.
- Using a statistically-driven approach, we are able to push beyond the limits of existing spectroscopic data sets, measuring the satellite quenched fraction down to satellite stellar masses of ${\sim}10^7~{\rm M}_{\odot}$in group environments (${M}_{\rm{halo}} = 10^{13-14}~h^{-1}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$).
- Pushing to lower masses, we find that the fraction of passive satellites increases, potentially signaling a change in the dominant quenching mechanism at ${M}_{\star} \sim 10^{9}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$.

- We investigate, by combining dark-matter only N-body simulations with a semi-analytic framework, whether the conditions for the formation of massive seed BHs from synchronised atomic-cooling halo pairs and/or dynamically-heated mini-haloes are fulfilled in the overdense regions where the progenitors of a typical high-redshift quasar host form and evolve.
- 关键条件 i.e strong halo clustering and high star formation rates, are crucial to produce a non-negligible number of massive seed BH host candidates: we find $\approx1400$dynamically heated metal-free mini-haloes, including one of these which evolves to a synchronised pair and ends up in the massive quasar-host halo by $z=6$.
- Our results further suggest that multiple massive seed BHs may form in or near the quasar host's progenitors, potentially merging at lower redshifts and yielding gravitational wave events.

- This interaction is generally thought of as a contact force per area, however we point out that these gases must interact in a hydrodynamic fashion, and argue that this will lead to mixing of the galactic gas with the ICM wind.
	- We develop an analytic framework for how mixing is related to the acceleration of stripped gas from a satellite galaxy.
- Focusing on the dense clumps in the stripped tails, we find that they are nearly uniformly mixed with the ICM, indicating that all gas in the tail mixes with the surroundings, and dense clumps are not separate entities to be modeled differently than diffuse gas.
- We find that while mixing drives acceleration of stripped gas, the density and velocity of the surrounding wind will determine whether the mixing results in the heating of stripped gas into the ICM, or the cooling of the ICM into dense clouds.

##### [Pair Lines of Sight Observations of Multiphase Gas Bearing O VI in a Galaxy Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05065) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05065.pdf)

- Using $HST$/COS observations of the twin quasar lines of sight Q$0107-025$A $\&$Q$0107-025$B, we report on the physical properties, chemical abundances and transverse sizes of gas in a multiple galaxy environment at $z = 0.399$across a transverse separation of $520$kpc.
- The absorber towards Q$0107-025$B has $\log N(H I)/cm^{-2} \approx 16.8$(partial Lyman limit) while the absorber towards the other sightline has $N(H I) \approx 2$dex lower.
- The O VI along both sightlines have comparable column densities and broad $b$-values, whereas the low ionization lines are considerably narrower.
- The low ionization gas is inconsistent with the O VI when modelled assuming photoionization in a single phase.
- Along both the lines-of-sight, O VI and coinciding broad H I are best explained through collisional ionization in a cooling plasma with solar metallicity.
- Ionization models infer $1/10$-th solar metallicity for the pLLS and solar metallicity for the lower column density absorber along the other sightline.
- Within $\pm~250~km~s^{-1}$and $2$Mpc of projected distance from the sightlines 12 galaxies are identified, of which 3 are within $300$kpc.
- One of them is a dwarf galaxy while the other two are intermediate mass systems at impact parameters of $\rho \sim (1-4)R_{vir}$.
- The O VI along both lines-of-sight could be either tracing narrow transition temperature zones at the interface of low ionization gas and the hot halo of nearest galaxy, or a more spread-out warm gas bound to the circumgalactic halo/intragroup medium.
- This latter scenario leads to a warm gas mass limit of $M \gtrsim 4.5 \times 10^{9}$M$_\odot$.

- #cosmology/h0 #hubble_tension  
- The distance ladder using supernovae yields higher values of the Hubble constant $H_0$than those inferred from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy surveys, a discrepancy that has come to be known as the 'Hubble tension'.
- This has motivated the exploration of extensions to the standard cosmological model in which higher values of $H_0$can be obtained from CMB measurements and galaxy surveys.
- The trouble, however, goes beyond $H_0$; such modifications affect other quantities, too.
- In particular, their effects on cosmic times are usually neglected.
- We explore here the implications that measurements of the age $t_{\rm U}$of the Universe, such as a recent inference from the age of the oldest globular clusters, can have for potential solutions to the $H_0$tension.
- The value of $H_0$inferred from the CMB and galaxy surveys is related to the sound horizon at CMB decoupling (or at radiation drag), but it is also related to the matter density and to $t_{\rm U}$.
- Given this observation, we show how model-independent measurements may support or disfavor proposed new-physics solutions to the Hubble tension.
- Finally, we argue that cosmological measurements today provide constraints that, within a given cosmological model, represent an over-constrained system, offering a powerful diagnostic tool of consistency.
- We propose the use of ternary plots to simultaneously visualize independent constraints on key quantities related to $H_0$like $t_{\rm U}$, the sound horizon at radiation drag, and the matter density parameter.
- We envision that this representation will help find a solution to the trouble of and beyond $H_0$.

##### [Confirming ALMA Calibration using Planck and ACT Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05079) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05079.pdf)

- We test the accuracy of ALMA flux density calibration by comparing ALMA flux density measurements of extragalactic sources to measurements made by the Planck mission; Planck is absolutely calibrated to sub-percent precision using the dipole signal induced by the satellite's orbit around the solar system barycenter.
- Planck observations ended before ALMA began systematic observations, however, and many of the sources are variable, so we employ measurements by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) to bridge the two epochs.
- We find the ALMA flux density scale (based on observations of Uranus) is consistent with Planck; for instance ALMA flux densities in Band 3 ($\sim$100 GHz) average $0.99 \pm 0.02$times those measured by Planck.
- We also test the absolute calibration of both ACT and the South Pole Telescope (SPT), again with reference to Planck, as well as the internal consistency of Planck, ACT and SPT measurements of compact sources.

##### [Measuring anisotropic stress with relativistic effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05086) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05086.pdf)

- One of the main goal of large-scale structure surveys is to test the consistency of General Relativity at cosmological scales.
- In the $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology, the relations between the fields describing the geometry and the content of our Universe are uniquely determined.
- In particular, the two gravitational potentials -- that describe the spatial and temporal fluctuations in the geometry -- are equal.
- Whereas large classes of dark energy models preserve this equality, theories of modified gravity generally create a difference between the potentials, known as anisotropic stress.
- Even though measuring this anisotropic stress is one of the key goals of large-scale structure surveys, there are currently no methods able to measure it directly.
- Current methods all rely on measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities (through redshift-space distortions), from which the time component of the metric is inferred, assuming that dark matter follows geodesics.
- If this is not the case, all the proposed tests fail to measure the anisotropic stress.
- In this letter, we propose a novel test which directly measures anisotropic stress, without relying on any assumption about the unknown dark matter.
- Our method uses relativistic effects in the galaxy number counts to provide a direct measurement of the time component of the metric.
- By comparing this with lensing observations our test provides a direct measurement of the anisotropic stress.

- MUSE观测：We measured flat and sometimes inverted oxygen abundance gradients in the subsystems composing NGC 1487, explained by metal mixing processes common in merging galaxies.
- The kinematic map revealed a rotating pattern in the gas in the northern tail of the system, suggesting that the galaxy may be in the process of rebuilding a disc.
- The gas located in the central region has larger velocity dispersion ($\sigma\approx 50$km s$^{-1}$) than the remaining regions, indicating kinematic heating, possibly owing to the ongoing interaction.
- Similar trends were, however, not observed in the stellar velocity-dispersion map, indicating that the galaxy has not yet achieved equilibrium, and the nebular and stellar components are still kinematically decoupled.
- Based on all our measurements and findings, and specially on the mass estimates, metallicity gradients and velocity fields of the system, we propose that NGC 1487 is the result of an ongoing merger event involving smallish dwarf galaxies within a group, in a pre-merger phase, resulting in a relic with mass and physical parameters similar to a dwarf galaxy.
- Thus, we may be witnessing the formation of a dwarf galaxy by merging of smaller clumps at z=0.

	- We find that nine of the galaxies show disturbed [CII] emission, either due to a close companion galaxy or recent merger.
	- Ten galaxies have smooth velocity gradients consistent with the emission arising from a gaseous disk.
	- The remaining eight quasar host galaxies show no velocity gradient, suggesting that the gas in these systems is dispersion-dominated.
	- All galaxies show high velocity dispersions with a mean of 129+-10 km/s.
- Comparison between the dynamical mass and the mass of the supermassive black hole reveals that the sample falls above the locally derived bulge mass--black hole mass relation at 2.4sigma significance.
- Using several different estimators for the molecular mass, we estimate a gas mass fraction of >10%, indicating gas makes up a large fraction of the baryonic mass of z~6 quasar host galaxies.

##### [The Physics of Galactic Winds Driven by Cosmic Rays I: Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05696) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05696.pdf)

- We elucidate the physics of CR-driven galactic winds for CR transport dominated by diffusion.
	- We use analytic estimates validated by time-dependent spherically-symmetric simulations to derive expressions for the mass-loss rate, momentum flux, and speed of CR-driven galactic winds, suitable for cosmological-scale or semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.
- For CR diffusion coefficients $\kappa \gtrsim r_0 c_i$where $r_0$is the base radius of the wind and $c_i$is the isothermal gas sound speed, the asymptotic wind energy flux is comparable to that supplied to CRs, and the outflow rapidly accelerates to supersonic speeds.
- By contrast, for $\kappa \lesssim r_0 c_i$, CR-driven winds accelerate more slowly and lose most of their energy to gravity, a CR analogue of photon-tired stellar winds.
- Given CR diffusion coefficients estimated using Fermi gamma-ray observations of pion decay, we predict mass-loss rates in CR-driven galactic winds of order the star formation rate for dwarf and disc galaxies.
- The dwarf galaxy mass-loss rates are small compared to the mass-loadings needed to reconcile the stellar and dark matter halo mass functions.
- For nuclear starbursts (e.g., M82, Arp 220), CR diffusion and pion losses suppress the CR pressure in the galaxy and the strength of CR-driven winds.

	- The stacked emission of the sources without detection does not reveal any signal in any band.
- Based on the untargeted detection, we find 66 additional X-ray sources that are consistent with being lensed sources.

- We present the discovery of the fading radio transient FIRST J153350.8+272729.
- The source had a maximum observed 5-GHz radio luminosity of $8\times10^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$in 1986, but by 2019 had faded by a factor of nearly 400.
- We show that a tidal disruption event (TDE) is the preferred scenario for FIRST J153350.8+272729, although it could plausibly be interpreted as the afterglow of a long-duration gamma-ray burst. 第二个在射电波段发现的TDE

- In this work, we used machine learning (ML) methods to generate model SEDs and fit sparse observations of LLAGNs.
	- The ML method performs the fit $4 \times 10^5$times faster than previous semianalytic models.
	- As a proof-of-concept, we used the ML model to reproduce the SEDs of the LLAGNs M87, NGC 315 and NGC 4261.

##### [Spectropolarimetry of low redshift Quasars: origin of the polarization and implications for black hole mass estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05935) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05935.pdf)

- 1. The broad line region (BLR) and continuum polarization are both produced by a single scattering medium.
- 2. The scattering medium is equatorial, and at right angle to the system axis.
- 3. The scattering medium is located at or just outside the BLR.
- The observed line width is found to be affected by inclination, which can lead to an underestimate of the black hole mass by a factor of $\sim 5$for a close-to face-on view.
	- The line width measured in the polarized flux overcomes the inclination bias, and provides a close-to equatorial view of the BLR in all AGN, which allows to reduce the inclination bias in the BLR based black hole mass estimates.

	- 在250kpc以外的平均比例在20%左右: as expected from simulations, due to newly accreted material thermalizing via a series of shocks.
- Also in agreement with simulations, we find significant cluster-to-cluster variation in Pnt/Ptot and little difference in the ensemble average Pnt/Ptot based on dynamical state.

- #cluster/galaxy #galaxy/environment 
- D4UD01 @ z = 3.24: 450 Ks-selected galaxies with photo-z at 3.0 < z < 3.4, among which ~ 12% are classified as quiescent galaxies.
	- The quiescent galaxies are largely concentrated in the overdense protocluster region with a higher quiescent fraction, showing a sign of environmental quenching.
- Galaxies in the protocluster are forming faster than the field counterparts as seen in the stellar mass function, suggesting early and accelerated mass assembly in the overdense regions.
- Our work shed light on how the formation of massive galaxies is affected in the dense region of a protocluster when the Universe was only 2 Gyr old.

##### [SDSS-IV MaNGA: Radial Gradients in Stellar Population Properties of Early-Type and Late-Type Galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06703) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06703.pdf)

- #galaxy/spop #stellar_population #survey/manga
- We study a large sample of 1900 galaxies spanning $8.6 - 11.3 \log M/M_{\odot}$in stellar mass, through key absorption features in stacked spectra from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey.
- We find flat age and negative metallicity gradients for ETGs and negative age and negative metallicity gradients for LTGs.
- Age gradients in LTGs steepen with increasing galaxy mass, from $-0.05\pm0.11~\log$Gyr/R$_e$for the lowest mass galaxies to $-0.82\pm0.08~\log$Gyr/R$_e$for the highest mass ones. This strong gradient-mass relation has a slope of $-0.70\pm0.18$.
- Comparing local age and metallicity gradients with the velocity dispersion $\sigma$within galaxies against the global relation with $\sigma$shows that internal processes regulate metallicity in ETGs but not age, and vice versa for LTGs.
- Both galaxy types display flat [C/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], and negative [Na/Fe] gradients, whereas only LTGs display gradients in [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe].
- ETGs have increasingly steep [Na/Fe] gradients with local $\sigma$reaching $6.50\pm0.78$dex/$\log$km/s for the highest masses.
	- [Na/Fe] ratios are correlated with metallicity for both galaxy types across the entire mass range in our sample, providing support for metallicity dependent supernova yields.

- #galaxy/environment #cluster/galaxy 
- We identify three prominent filaments along which galaxies seem to be entering the Supergroup (mostly in E-W directions).
	- Thus, galaxy evolution responds to the external environment as strongly in these unrelaxed systems as we find in rich and relaxed clusters.
- From these data, local density remains the primary factor with a secondary role for distance from the inferred center of the entire structure's potential well.
- We see changes in lower-mass galaxies (M $<$$10^{10.5}$$M_{sun}$) at four times the virial radius of major substructures, while the more massive $NUV$Green Valley galaxies show low levels of star formation within two virial radii.
	- Suppression of star formation ("quenching") occurs in the infall regions of these structures even before galaxies enter the denser group environment.

- Although standard fitting routines do consistently well depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectral features, the neural network can also excel at predictions in the low signal-to-noise regime within the controlled environment of the training set as well as on observed data when the source spectral properties are well constrained by models.

- #ssst/mw
- The new catalog contains 120,571 low-resolution spectra for 98,736 unique stars between $10 < G < 22$spread across the HETDEX footprint at relatively high ($b\sim60^\circ$) Galactic latitudes.
- Since these RVs are for faint ($G\geq16$) stars, they will be complementary to Gaia.
- Using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), we also demonstrate that the HETDEX spectra can be used to determine a star's T${\rm{eff}}$, and log g and its [Fe/H].

##### [Core Mass Estimates in Strong Lensing Galaxy Clusters Using a Single-Halo Lens Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06351) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06351.pdf)

- #cluster/halo #strong_lensing 
- Here, we evaluate the use of a Single-Halo model (SHM) as an efficient method to estimate the strong lensing cluster core mass, testing it with ray-traced images from the 'Outer Rim' simulation.
- We find that the projected core mass estimated with this method, M$_{\rm SHM}$, has a scatter of $8.52\%$and a bias of $0.90\%$compared to the "true" mass within the same aperture.
- We find that the SHM success depends on the lensing geometry, with single giant arc configurations accounting for most of the failed cases due to their limiting constraining power.
- Finally, we find that when the source redshift is unknown, the model-predicted redshifts are overestimated, and the M$_{\rm SHM}$is underestimated by a few percent, highlighting the importance of securing spectroscopic redshifts of background sources.

- #smbh #galaxy/etg
- The exceptionally large mass of the black hole coupled with its low redshift makes it one of only a handful of black holes for which spatially resolved temperature and density profiles can be obtained within the Bondi radius with the high spatial resolution of Chandra.
- Within a $\sim\!3$kpc radius, we find two temperature components with statistical significance.
	- Both the single temperature and two temperature models show only a very slight rise in temperature towards the centre, and are consistent with being flat.
- The density profile follows a relatively shallow $\rho\propto~r^{-[0.61\pm0.13]}$relationship within the Bondi radius, which suggests that the true accretion rate on to the black hole may be lower than the classical Bondi accretion rate.

- In the context of intra-cluster medium turbulence, it is essential to be able to split the turbulent velocity field in a compressive and a solenoidal component.
- We describe and implement a new method for this aim, i.e, performing a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, in multi-grid, multi-resolution descriptions, focusing on (but not being restricted to) the outputs of AMR cosmological simulations.

- FIRE-2 simulations to examine 3-D variations of gas-phase elemental abundances of [O/H], [Fe/H], and [N/H] in 11 Milky Way (MW) and M31-mass galaxies across their formation histories at $z \leq 1.5$($t_{\rm lookback} \leq 9.4$Gyr), motivated by characterizing the initial conditions of stars for chemical tagging.
- Over time negative radial gradients of abundance become steeper while azimuthal variations become weaker (more homogeneous).
- Furthermore, elemental abundances are measurably homogeneous (to $\lesssim 0.05$dex) across a radial range of $\Delta R \approx 3.5$kpc at $z \gtrsim 1$and $\Delta R \approx 1.7$kpc at $z = 0$.
- We also measure full distributions of elemental abundances, finding typically negatively skewed normal distributions at $z \gtrsim 1$that evolve to typically Gaussian distributions by $z = 0$.

- #machine_learning 
- Wide-field sub-millimetre surveys have driven many major advances in galaxy evolution in the past decade, but without extensive follow-up observations the coarse angular resolution of these surveys limits the science exploitation.
- Here we present an autoencoder with a novel loss function to overcome this problem in the sub-millimeter wavelength range.
- This approach is successfully demonstrated on Herschel SPIRE COSMOS data, with the super-resolving target being the JCMT SCUBA-2 observations of the same field.

- Characterization of the relations between star-formation rate, stellar mass and molecular gas mass surface densities at different spatial scales across galaxies (from galaxy wide to kpc-scales).
	- Those relations are the same at the different explored scales, sharing the same distributions for the explored data
- We propose that these relations are the projection of a single relation between the three properties that follows a distribution well described by a line in the three-dimension parameter space.

- #machine_learning 
- In this pilot study, we investigate the use of a deep learning (DL) model to temporally evolve the dynamics of gas accreting onto a black hole in the form of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF).
- We have trained a machine to forecast such a spatiotemporally chaotic system -- i.e black hole weather forecasting -- using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a training dataset which consists of numerical solutions of the hydrodynamical equations, for a range of initial conditions.

##### [The Physical Drivers of the Luminosity-Weighted Dust Temperatures in High-Redshift Galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06250) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06250.pdf)

- It has been claimed in the literature that a galaxy's dust temperature -- observed as the wavelength where the dust SED peaks ($\lambda_{peak}$) -- is traced most closely by its specific star-formation rate (sSFR) or parameterized 'distance' to the SFR-M$_\star$relation (the galaxy 'main sequence').
- We conclude that the more fundamental tracer of galaxies' luminosity-weighted integrated dust temperatures are indeed their star-formation surface densities in line with local Universe results, which relate closely to the underlying geometry of dust in the ISM.

- SPHERE/VLT观测NGC1068
- We are able to separate the dominant polarising mechanisms in the three regions of the ionisation cone, the extended envelop of the torus and the very central bright source of the AGN.
	- Dichroic absorption is estimated to be responsible for about 99 % of the polarised flux coming from the photo-centre.
- However, this contribution would be restricted to this location only, double scattering process being the most important contributor to polarisation in the equatorial plane of the AGN and single scattering being dominant in the polar outflow bi-cone.

- We reconstruct the gamma-ray image of M31 in a template-independent way, and we show that flat spatial models are preferred by data, indicating an extension of the $\gamma$-ray emission of about 0.3-0.4 degree for the bulge of M31.
- This study also suggests that a second component, extending to at least 1 degree, contributes to the observed total emission.

- We present the first high-resolution and high-sensitivity polarimetry study of the merging galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 in the 1-4 GHz frequency band.
- For the first time in a radio relic, we observe a decreasing polarization fraction in the downstream region.
	- Possibly explained by geometrical projections and/or by decreasing of the magnetic field anisotropy towards the cluster center.
- From the amount of depolarization of the only detected background radio galaxy, we estimate a turbulent magnetic field strength of $B_{\rm turb}\sim5.6~\mu$Gauss in the relic.
