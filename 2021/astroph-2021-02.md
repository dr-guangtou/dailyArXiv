##### [A Photometric and Kinematic Analysis of UDG1137+16: Probing Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy Formation in a Group Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00598)

- #galaxy/dwarf #galaxy/udg 
- Our new analyses confirm both its environmental association with the low density UGC 6594 group, along with its large size of 3.3 kpc and status as a UDG.
	- The new imaging reveals two distinct stellar components for UDG1137+16, indicating that a central stellar body is surrounded by an outer stellar envelope undergoing tidal interaction.
- We measure a stellar velocity dispersion within the half-light radius (15 ± 4 km s−1) and find that UDG1137+16 is similar to some other UDGs in that it is likely dark matter dominated.

##### [Rapid sorting of radio galaxy morphology using Haralick features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00843)

- #galaxy/morphology
- The set of thirteen Haralick features represent an extremely compact non-parametric representation of image texture, and are calculated directly from imagery using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
- 基于LoTSS数据：we demonstrate that Haralick features are highly efficient, rotationally invariant descriptors of radio galaxy morphology.
- 同时利用HDBSCAN技术进行分类
- 关于Haralick特征：
	- Haralick features were introduced by Haralick et al. (1973) as a statistical method of examining image texture.  They consider the relationship between the intensity of neighbouring pixels and are useful in classifying similar regions in an image given the local spatial distribution of pixel intensities.
	-  Haralick features are based on the so-called Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). To compute the Haralick features, one must first compute the GLCM, which can then be used to evaluate the Haralick coefficients.

- #cosmology/sz 
- We measure the kSZ effect due to ionized gas traced by infrared-selected galaxies from the \\emph{unWISE} catalog. 
	- We employ the "projected-field" kSZ estimator, which does not require spectroscopic galaxy redshifts.
- Using a new "asymmetric" estimator that combines different foreground-cleaned CMB maps to maximize the signal-to-noise, we measure the kSZ2\-galaxy cross-power spectrum
	- 对z=0.6, 1.1, 1.5的三个样本得到了探测
	- We discuss possible explanations for the excess kSZ signal associated with the z≈1.1 sample, and show that foreground contamination in the CMB maps is very unlikely to be the cause.

- 关于CMB B-mode偏振探测中的去除lensing效应的影响：the lensing effects can be partially removed by combining high-resolution E\-mode measurements with an estimate of the projected matter distribution. 
	- For near-future experiments, the best estimate of the latter will arise from co-adding internal reconstructions (derived from the CMB itself) with external tracers of the large-scale structure such as the cosmic infrared background (CIB).
- Mitigation techniques based on multi-frequency cleaning appear to be very effective.
- By means of an analytic model, that the bias arising from the higher-point functions of the CIB itself ought to be negligible.

##### [A Search for correlations between turbulence and star formation in LITTLE THINGS dwarf irregular galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00040)

- We looked for relationships between SF traced by FUV images, and gas turbulence traced by kinetic energy density (KED) and velocity dispersion
- The excess KED associated with SF implies a ∼0.5% efficiency for supernova energy to pump local HI turbulence on the scale of resolution here, which is a factor of ∼2 too small for all of the turbulence on a galactic scale.
	- The excess vdisp in SF regions is also small
- The local excess in ΣHI corresponding to an excess in ΣSFR is consistent with an HI consumption time of ∼1.6 Gyr in the inner parts of the galaxies.

##### [A Graphical Interpretation of Circumgalactic Precipitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00056)

- #galaxy/cgm 
- 目前关于CGM的一个假设： a self-regulating feedback loop suspends the gas density of the ambient CGM close to the galaxy in a state with a ratio of cooling time to freefall time >10.
	- 当这个比值小于10，冷气体会从CGM中凝结出来，集中落向星系中心，触发新的feedback
	- The astrophysical origin of this so-called precipitation limit is not simple but is critical to understanding the CGM and its role in galaxy evolution
- 本文尝试从概念上解释：It illustrates how the precipitation limit can depend on both the global configuration of a galactic atmosphere and the degree to which dynamical disturbances drive CGM perturbations.

##### [The central parsec of NGC 3783: a rotating broad emission line region, asymmetric hot dust structure, and compact coronal line region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00068)

- SINFONI + GRAVITY: We find the BLR probed through broad Brγ emission is well described by a rotating, thick disk with a radial distribution of clouds peaking in the inner region
- In our BLR model the physical mean radius of 16 light days is nearly twice the 10 day time lag that would be measured, which matches very well the 10 day time lag that has been measured by reverberation mapping.
- 看到的热尘埃结构有offset迹象：可能是正被吸积的团块
- We directly measure the FWHM size of the nuclear CLR as traced by the \[CaVIII\] and narrow Brγ line. We find a FWHM size of 2.2 mas (0.4 pc), fully in line with the expectation of the CLR located between the BLR and narrow line region.

##### [A new analytic ram pressure profile for satellite galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00132)

- 冲压剥离理论模型的比较：传统的beta-profile缺乏对halo质量和距离halo中心距离的依赖
- we introduce a new universal analytic model for the profiles consisting in a damped power law, and we provide a new set of fitted parameters which can recover the ram pressure dependence on halo mass and redshifts.
- We find the number of galaxies experiencing large amounts of accumulated ram pressure stripping have low stellar mass
	- Their specific star formation rates depend significantly on the ram pressure modelling, particularly at high redshifts (z\>1.5).

##### [Detection of an ionized gas outflow in the extreme UV-luminous star-forming galaxy BOSS-EUVLG1 at z=2.47](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00774)

	- We report the detection of a broad Hα component carrying 25% of the total Hα flux. 指示了一个大质量的高速外流；外流速度接近600km/s
	- 外流可以用SF解释，不需要AGN; 而且mass loading factor显示外流不足以quench SF；只有少部分外流能超过逃逸速度
- The ionized phase of the outflow does not carry the mass and energy to play a relevant role neither in the evolution of the host galaxy nor in the enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

##### [Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder: I. System Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01870) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01870.pdf)

- ASKAP is one of the first radio telescopes to deploy phased array feed (PAF) technology on a large scale, giving it an instantaneous field of view that covers 31 square degrees at 800 MHz.
- As a two-dimensional array of 36x12m antennas, with baselines ranging from 22m to 6km, ASKAP also has excellent snapshot imaging capability and 10 arcsecond resolution.
- It is an excellent telescope for surveys between 700 MHz and 1800 MHz and is expected to facilitate great advances in our understanding of galaxy formation, cosmology and radio transients while opening new parameter space for discovery of the unknown.

##### [Toward a more stringent test of gravity with redshift space power spectrum: simultaneous probe of growth and amplitude of large-scale structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01785) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01785.pdf)

- #cosmology/rsd #ssst/cos
- In the presence of galaxy bias, however, the RSD measurement at large scales, where the linear theory prediction is safely applied, is known to exhibit a degeneracy between the parameters of structure growth f and fluctuation amplitude sigma8, and one can only constrain the parameters in the form of fsigma8.
- In order to disentangle this degeneracy, in this paper, we go beyond the linear theory, and consider the model of RSD applicable to a weakly nonlinear regime.
- We show that upcoming galaxy survey of the stage-IV class can unambiguously determine sigma8 at the precision down to 10% at higher redshifts even if we restrict the accessible scales to k<0.16h/Mpc

##### [Information Content of Higher-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01696) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01696.pdf)

- Constraints available from joint analysis of the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 3-Point Correlation Function) can, in some cases, exceed those offered by the initial power spectrum even when the reconstruction is perfect.
- In particular, we show that for the z = 0 real-space matter field in the limit of vanishing shot noise, taking modes up to k_max = 0.2 h/Mpc, using the bispectrum alone offers a factor of two reduction in the variance on the cosmic distance scale relative to that available from the power spectrum.

- #galaxy_halo
- "the spin$-$orbit alignment (SOA)"  - a coherence between the spin vector of a galaxy and the orbital motion of its neighbors.
- 在Illustris模拟中:
	- (a) There exists a clear preference for prograde orientations (i.e., SOA) for galaxy pairs, qualitatively consistent with observations.
	- (b) The SOA is significant for both baryonic and dark matter spins, being the strongest for gas and the weakest for dark matter.
	- (c) The SOA is stronger for less massive targets and for targets having closer neighbors.
	- (d) The SOA strengthens for galaxies in low-density regions, and the signal is dominated by central$-$satellite pairs in low-mass halos.
	- (e) There is an explicit dependence of the SOA on the duration of interaction with its current neighbor.
- Taken together, we propose that the SOA witnessed at $z = 0$ has been developed mainly by interactions with a neighbor for an extended period of time, rather than tidal torque from the ambient large-scale structure.

##### [On the relation between Lya absorbers and local galaxy filaments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01713) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01713.pdf)

- #galaxy/igm
- We aim at characterising the relation between Lya absorbers and nearby overdense cosmological structures (galaxy filaments) at recession velocities Delta v \leq 6700 km/s by using archival observational data from various instruments.
- Along the 91 sightlines that pass close to a filament, we identify 215 (227) Lya absorption systems (components).
	- Among these, 74 Lya systems are aligned in position and velocity with the galaxy filaments, indicating that these absorbers and the galaxies trace the same large-scale structure.
- The strongest Lya absorbers are preferentially found near galaxies or close to the axis of a filament, although there is substantial scatter in this relation.

##### [Improved Treatment of Host-Galaxy Correlations in Cosmological Analyses With Type Ia Supernovae](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01776) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01776.pdf)

- Using a spectroscopically-confirmed sample of $\sim$1600 SNIa, we develop the first empirical model of underlying populations for SNIa light-curve properties that includes their dependence on host-galaxy stellar mass.
- These populations are important inputs to simulations that are used to model selection effects and correct distance biases within the BEAMS with Bias Correction (BBC) framework.
- Here we improve BBC to also account for SNIa-host correlations, and we validate this technique on simulated data samples.
- We recover the input relationship between SNIa luminosity and host-galaxy stellar mass (the mass step, $\gamma$) to within 0.004 mags, which is a factor of 5 improvement over the previous method that results in a $\gamma$-bias of ${\sim}0.02$.
- We adapt BBC for a novel dust-based model of intrinsic brightness variations, which results in a greatly reduced mass step for data ($\gamma = 0.017 \pm 0.008$), and for simulations ($\gamma =0.006 \pm 0.007$).
- Analysing simulated SNIa, the biases on the dark energy equation-of-state, $w$, vary from $\Delta w = 0.006(5)$ to $0.010(5)$ with our new BBC method; these biases are significantly smaller than the $0.02(5)$ $w$-bias using previous BBC methods that ignore SNIa-host correlations.

##### [Orphan galaxies in semi-analytic models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01837) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01837.pdf)

- #galaxy/sam #galaxy_halo
- The model proposed takes into account the dynamical friction drag, mass loss by tidal stripping and a proximity merger criterion, also it is simple enough to be inexpensive from a computational point of view.
- We show that while the halo mass function fails to put tight constraints on the dynamical friction, the addition of clustering information helps to better define the parameters of the model related to the spatial distribution of subhalos.
- Using the model with the best fit parameters allows us to reproduce the halo mass function to a precision better than 5 per cent, and the two point correlation function at a precision better than 10 per cent.

##### [The AMBRE Project: Origin and evolution of sulfur in the Milky Way](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01961) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01961.pdf)

- Sulfur is a volatile chemical element that plays an important role in tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies.
- We find that the [S/M] abundances ratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime, and then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]~-1.0dex.
	- This decrease continues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently reported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models.
	- Moreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very different kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich and sulfur-poor ones.

##### [A new panchromatic classification of unclassified Burst Alert Telescope active galactic nuclei](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02044) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02044.pdf)

- Focusing on the 36 sources with measured redshift, we compute their spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to $\gamma$-rays with the aim to classify these objects.
- We found a large fraction of absorbed radio-quiet AGNs (31 out of 36) and some additional rare radio-loud sources (5 out of 36), since the jet emission in hard X-rays is important for aligned jets owing to the boost produced by the beaming effect.
- With our work we can confirm the hypothesis that a number of galaxies, whose optical spectra lack AGN emission features, host an obscured active nucleus.

##### [3D Modelling and Visualisation of Observed Galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02141) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02141.pdf)

- #cluster/icm #cluster/galaxy
- ALMA, ATCA, MUSE, Herschel; gas-to-dust ratios in 15 Fornax cluster galaxies 大部分是矮星系
- Gas-to-dust ratios in Fornax galaxies are systematically lower than those in field galaxies at fixed stellar mass/metallicity.
- This implies that a relatively large fraction of the metals in these Fornax systems is locked up in dust, which is possibly due to altered chemical evolution as a result of the dense environment.
- 不仅是HI气体比例低，分子气体也很缺乏; 和Virgo cluster不一样
- We propose various explanations for the low H$_2$-to-dust ratios in the Fornax cluster, including the more efficient stripping of H$_2$ compared to dust, more efficient enrichment of dust in the star formation process, and altered ISM physics in the cluster environment.

- #galaxy/bcg #galaxy/halo
- We explore the stellar mass density and colour profiles of 118 low redshift,

- However, we also see a flattening of the profile ($\Sigma_* \sim 10^{7.5}$ M$_\odot$ kpc$^{-2}$) in the outskirts (up to 10 R$_{\mathrm{e}}$), which is revealed by our method of specifically targeting tidal/accretion features.
	- 这个变平很可能和PDR2 sky background的under-subtraction有关

- Three edge-on lenticular galaxies from the Fornax3D project -- FCC 153, FCC 170, and FCC 177 -- in order to infer their mass assembly histories individually and in the context of the Fornax cluster.
	- We find that the galaxies studied here have all been able to form dynamically-cold (intrinsic vertical velocity dispersion $\sigma_z \lesssim 50\ {\rm km}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$) stellar disks after cluster infall.
	- The pre-existing (old) high angular momentum components have retained their angular momentum (orbital circularity $\lambda_z > 0.8$) through to the present day.
- 和NGC3115这种低密度环境下的星系比，可以看到因为cluster环境导致的恒星吸积和并合过程的减少
- There is tentative evidence for enhancement in the luminosity-weighted intrinsic vertical velocity dispersion due to the cluster environment.
	- But importantly, there is an indication that metallicity may be a key driver of this relation.

- In Necib $\&$ Lin (2021), we introduced a strategy to robustly measure the escape velocity. 本文加入了对银河系子结构的考虑
- Based on a fit with three bound components to account for the disk, relaxed halo, and the Gaia Sausage, we find the escape velocity of the Milky Way at the solar position to be $v_{\rm{esc}}= 484.6^{+17.8}_{-7.4}$ km/s.
- Assuming a Navarro-Frenck-White dark matter profile, and taken in conjunction with a recent measurement of the circular velocity at the solar position of $v_c = 230 \pm 10$ km/s, we find a Milky Way concentration of $c_{200} = 13.8^{+6.0}_{-4.3}$ and a mass of $M_{200} = 7.0^{+1.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, which is considerably lighter than previous measurements.

- We confirm that a significant gamma-ray signal is observed within the characteristic radius $\theta_{500}$ of the Coma cluster, with a test statistic TS~27 for our baseline model. Coma星系团中的Gamma-ray信号
- The presence of a possible point source may account for most of the observed signal.

- Assuming an hadronic origin of the signal, our results provide the first quantitative measurement of the cosmic ray proton content in a cluster.

##### [Probing the physical properties of the intergalactic medium using gamma-ray bursts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02530) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02530.pdf)

- #galaxy/igm
- We use Gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra total continuum absorption to estimate the key intergalactic medium (IGM) properties of hydrogen column density ($\mathit{N}\textsc{hxigm}$), metallicity, temperature and ionisation parameter over a redshift range of $1.6 \leq z \leq 6.3$, using photo-ionisation (PIE) and collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) models for the ionised plasma.
- We find that the IGM property results are similar, regardless of whether the model assumes all PIE or CIE.
- The PIE model implies a less rapid decline in average metallicity with redshift compared to CIE.
- Using our model, we conclude that the IGM contributes substantially to the total absorption seen in GRB spectra and that this contribution rises with redshift, explaining why the hydrogen column density inferred from X-rays is substantially in excess of the intrinsic host contribution measured in UV.

- #cluster/galaxy 
- We searched for jellyfish galaxy candidates in a sample of 40 clusters from the DAFT/FADA and CLASH surveys covering the redshift range 0.2<z<0.9.
	- We found 81 jellyfish candidates in the extended region around MACS0717, and 97 in 22 other clusters.
	- We find that jellyfish candidates tend to be star forming objects, with blue colours, young ages, high star formation rates and specific star formation rates.
- Jellyfish galaxy candidates in MACS0717 tend to avoid the densest regions of the cluster, while this does not appear to be the case in the other clusters.

- #galaxy_halo
- We study subhalo orbital evolution using numerical calculations in which subhaloes are modelled as massless particles orbiting in a time-varying spherical potential.
- We find that the radial action of the subhalo orbit decreases over the first few orbits, indicating that the response to the growth of the host halo is not adiabatic during this phase. The subhalo orbits can shrink by a factor of $\sim$1.5 in this phase.
- Given these results, we consider the spatial distribution of the population of subhaloes identified in high-resolution cosmological simulations.
	- We find that it is consistent with this population having been accreted at z < 3, indicating that any subhaloes accreted earlier are unresolved in the simulations. 过早吸积进来的subhalo已经无法分辨

- Using high-state observations with simultaneous X-ray and UV/optical measurements, we investigate whether super-Eddington accreting AGNs exhibit different accretion disk-corona connections compared to sub-Eddington accreting AGNs.
- We find tight correlations between the X-ray-to-UV/optical spectral slope parameter ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and the monochromatic luminosity at $2500~\r{A}$($L_{\rm 2500~\r{A}}$) for both the super- and sub-Eddington subsamples.
- Super-Eddington accreting AGNs are not particularly X-ray weak in general compared to sub-Eddington accreting AGNs.
- A fraction of super-Eddington accreting AGNs show strong X-ray variability, probably due to small-scale gas absorption, and we highlight the importance of employing high-state (intrinsic) X-ray radiation to study the accretion disk-corona connections in AGNs.

##### [Radio multifrequency observations of galaxy clusters. The Abell 399$-$401 pair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02900) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02900.pdf)

- Galaxy clusters are assembled via merging of smaller structures, in a process that generates shocks and turbulence in the intra cluster medium and produces radio emission in the form of halos and relics.
- The cluster pair A 399-A 401 represents a special case: both clusters host a radio halo and recent LOFAR observations at 140~MHz revealed the presence of a radio bridge connecting the two clusters and two candidate relics, one South of A 399 and the other in between the two clusters in proximity of a shock front detected in X-ray observations.
- In this paper we present Westerbork observations at 1.7, 1.4 and 1.2~GHz and 346~MHz of the A 399-A 401 cluster pair.
- We detected the radio halo in the A 399 cluster at 346~MHz, extending up to $\sim 650$~kpc and with a $125 \pm 6$~mJy flux density.
- Its spectral index between 1.4~GHz and 346~MHz and between 140~MHz and 346~MHz is $\alpha = 1.47 \pm 0.05$, and $\alpha = 1.75 \pm 0.14$respectively.
- The two candidate relics are also seen at 346~MHz and we determined their spectral index to be $\alpha = 1.10 \pm 0.14$and $\alpha = 1.46 \pm 0.14$.
- The low surface brightness bridge connecting the two clusters is below the noise level at 346~MHz, therefore we constrained the bridge average spectral to be steep, i.e $\alpha > 1.5$at $2\sigma$confidence level.
- This result favours the scenario where dynamically-induced turbulence is a viable mechanism to reaccelerate a population of mildly relativistic particles and amplify magnetic fields even in cluster bridges, i.e on scales of a few Mpcs.

##### [Bar-like galaxies in IllustrisTNG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03076) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03076.pdf)

- We study a sample of bar-like galaxies in the Illustris TNG100 simulation, in which almost the whole stellar component is in the form of a prolate spheroid.
- The sample is different from the late-type barred galaxies studied before.
- In addition to the requirement of a high enough stellar mass and resolution, the 277 galaxies were selected based on the single condition of a low enough ratio of the intermediate to long axis of the stellar component.
- We followed the mass and shape evolution of the galaxies as well as their interactions with other objects and divided them into three classes based on the origin of the bar and the subsequent history.
- In galaxies of class A (comprising 28% of the sample), the bar was induced by an interaction with a larger object, most often a cluster or group central galaxy, and the galaxies were heavily stripped of dark matter and gas.
- In classes B and C (27% and 45% of the sample, respectively) the bars were induced by a merger or a passing satellite, or they were formed by disk instability.
- Class B galaxies were then partially stripped of mass, while those of class C evolved without strong interactions, thus retaining their dark matter and gas in the outskirts.
- We illustrate the properties of the different classes with three representative examples of individual galaxies.
- In spite of the different evolutionary histories, the bars are remarkably similar in strength, length, and formation times.
- The gas fraction in the baryonic component within two stellar half-mass radii at the time of bar formation is always below 0.4 and usually very low, which confirms in the cosmological context the validity of this threshold, which has previously been identified in controlled simulations.
- Observational counterparts of these objects can be found among early-type fast rotators, S0 galaxies, or red spirals with bars.

##### [A new approach for the statistical denoising of Planck interstellar dust polarization data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03160) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03160.pdf)

- Dust emission is the main foreground to Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization.
- Its statistical characterization must be derived from the analysis of observational data because the precision required for a reliable component separation is far greater than currently achievable with physical models of the turbulent magnetized interstellar medium.
- This letter takes a significant step towards this goal by proposing a method that retrieves non-Gaussian statistical characteristics of dust emission from noisy Planck polarization observations at 353 GHz.
- We devise a statistical denoising method based on the Wavelet Phase Harmonics (WPH) statistics, which characterize the coherent structures in non-Gaussian random fields and define a generative model of the data.
- The method is validated on mock data combining a dust map from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation and Planck noise maps.
- The denoised map reproduces the true power spectrum down to scales where the noise power is an order of magnitude larger than that of the signal.
- It remains highly correlated to the true emission and retrieves some of its non-Gaussian properties.
- Applied to Planck data, the method provides a new approach towards building a generative model of dust polarization that will characterize the full complexity of the dust emission.

- We estimate the strength and structure of the fields in the starburst galaxy M82 using thermal polarized emission observations from SOFIA/HAWC+ and a potential field extrapolation.
- We modified the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method to account for the large-scale flow and the turbulent field.
- Results show that the observed magnetic fields arise from the combination of a large-scale ordered potential field associated with the outflow and a small-scale turbulent field associated with bow-shock-like features.
- Within the central $900$pc radius, the potential field accounts for $53\pm4$% of the observed turbulent magnetic energy with a median field strength of $305\pm15$$\mu$G, while small-scale turbulent magnetic fields account for the remaining $40\pm5$% with a median field strength of $222\pm19$$\mu$G.
- We estimate that the turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energies are in close equipartition up to $\sim2$kpc (measured), while the turbulent kinetic energy dominates at $\sim7$kpc (extrapolated).
- We conclude that the fields are frozen into the ionized outflowing medium and driven away kinetically.
- This indicates that the magnetic field lines in the galactic wind of M82 are 'open,' providing a direct channel between the starburst core and the intergalactic medium.
- Our novel approach offers the tools needed to quantify the effects of outflows on galactic magnetic fields as well as their influence on the intergalactic medium and evolution of energetic particles.

##### [Evidence for r-process delay in very metal-poor stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03368) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03368.pdf)

- Currently, various types of astrophysical sites including neutron star mergers, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, are suggested as the origin of r-process elements.
	- The time delay between the star formation and the production of r-process elements is the key to distinguish these scenarios with the caveat that the diffusion of r-process elements in the interstellar medium also induces the delay in r-process enrichment because r-process events are rare.
- Here we study the observed Ba abundance data of very metal-poor stars as the tracer of the early enrichment history of r-process elements.
	- We find that the gradual increase of [Ba/Mg] with [Fe/H] requires a significant time delay (100 Myr -- 1 Gyr) of r-process events from star formation rather than the diffusion-induced delay.

##### [The origin of metal-poor stars on prograde disk orbits in FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03369) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03369.pdf)

- In hierarchical structure formation, metal-poor stars in and around the Milky Way (MW) originate primarily from mergers of lower-mass galaxies.
- A common expectation is therefore that metal-poor stars should have isotropic, dispersion-dominated orbits that do not correlate strongly with the MW disk.
- However, recent observations of stars in the MW show that metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2) stars are preferentially on prograde orbits with respect to the disk.
- Using the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW/M31-mass galaxies, we investigate the prevalence and origin of prograde metal-poor stars.
- Almost all (11 of 12) of our simulations have metal-poor stars preferentially on prograde orbits today and throughout most of their history: we thus predict that this is a generic feature of MW/M31-mass galaxies.
- The typical prograde-to-retrograde ratio is ~ 2:1, which depends weakly on stellar metallicity at [Fe/H] < -1.
- These trends predicted by our simulations agree well with MW observations.
- Prograde metal-poor stars originate largely from a single LMC/SMC-mass gas-rich galaxy merger, typically 7-12.5 Gyr ago, which deposited both existing metal-poor stars and significant gas on an orbital vector that sparked the formation of and/or shaped the orientation of a long-lived stellar disk, giving rise to a prograde bias for all low-metallicity stars.
- We also find sub-dominant contributions from in-situ stars formed in the host galaxy before this merger, and in some cases, additional massive mergers.
- We find few clear correlations between any properties of our MW/M31-mass galaxies at z=0 and the degree of this prograde bias as a result of diverse merger scenarios.

- We compare the radial profiles of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) in a sample of 169 star-forming galaxies in close pairs with those of mass-matched control galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey.
- We find that the sSFR is centrally enhanced (within one effective radius) in interacting galaxies by ~0.3 dex and that there is a weak sSFR suppression in the outskirts of the galaxies of ~0.1 dex.
- We stack the differences profiles for galaxies in five stellar mass bins between log(M/Mstar) = 9.0-11.5 and find that the sSFR enhancement has no dependence on the stellar mass.
- The same result is obtained when the comparison galaxies are matched to each paired galaxy in both stellar mass and redshift.
- In addition, we find that that the sSFR enhancement is elevated in pairs with nearly equal masses and closer projected separations, in agreement with previous work based on single-fiber spectroscopy.
- We also find that the sSFR offsets in the outskirts of the paired galaxies are dependent on whether the galaxy is the more massive or less massive companion in the pair.
- The more massive companion experiences zero to a positive sSFR enhancement while the less massive companion experiences sSFR suppression in their outskirts.
- Our results illustrate the complex tidal effects on star formation in closely paired galaxies.


##### [Wandering of the central black hole in a galactic nucleus and correlation of the black hole mass with the bulge mass](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03478) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03478.pdf)

- We investigate a mechanism for a super-massive black hole at the center of a galaxy to wander in the nucleus region.
- A situation is supposed in which the central black hole tends to move by the gravitational attractions from the nearby molecular clouds in a nuclear bulge but is braked via the dynamical frictions by the ambient stars there.
- We estimate the approximate kinetic energy of the black hole in an equilibrium between the energy gain rate through the gravitational attractions and the energy loss rate through the dynamical frictions, in a nuclear bulge composed of a nuclear stellar disk and a nuclear stellar cluster as observed from our Galaxy.
- The wandering distance of the black hole in the gravitational potential of the nuclear bulge is evaluated to get as large as several 10 pc, when the black hole mass is relatively small.
- The distance, however, shrinks as the black hole mass increases and the equilibrium solution between the energy gain and loss disappears when the black hole mass exceeds an upper limit.
- As a result, we can expect the following scenario for the evolution of the black hole mass: When the black hole mass is smaller than the upper limit, mass accretion of the interstellar matter in the circum-nuclear region, causing the AGN activities, makes the black hole mass larger.
- However, when the mass gets to the upper limit, the black hole loses the balancing force against the dynamical friction and starts spiraling downward to the gravity center.
- From simple parameter scaling, the upper mass limit of the black hole is found to be proportional to the bulge mass and this could explain the observed correlation of the black hole mass with the bulge mass.

##### [Halo shapes constrained from a pure sample of central galaxies in KiDS-1000](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03549) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03549.pdf)

- We present measurements of $f_h$, the ratio of the aligned components of the projected halo and galaxy ellipticities, for a sample of central galaxies using weak gravitational lensing data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS).
- Using a lens galaxy shape estimation that is more sensitive to outer galaxy regions, we find $f_{\rm h}=0.50\pm0.20$for our full sample and $f_{\rm h}=0.55\pm0.19$for an intrinsically red (and therefore higher stellar-mass) sub-sample, rejecting the hypothesis of round halos and/or galaxies being un-aligned with their parent halo at $2.5\sigma$and $2.9\sigma$, respectively.
- We quantify the 93.4% purity of our central galaxy sample using numerical simulations and overlapping spectroscopy from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey.
- This purity ensures that the interpretation of our measurements is not complicated by the presence of a significant fraction of satellite galaxies.
- Restricting our central galaxy ellipticity measurement to the inner isophotes, we find $f_{\rm h}=0.34\pm0.17$for our red sub-sample, suggesting that the outer galaxy regions are more aligned with their dark matter halos compared to the inner regions.
- Our results are in agreement with previous studies and suggest that lower mass halos are rounder and/or less aligned with their host galaxy than samples of more massive galaxies, studied in galaxy groups and clusters.

##### [CNN Architecture Comparison for Radio Galaxy Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03780) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03780.pdf)

- The morphological classification of radio sources is important to gain a full understanding of galaxy evolution processes and their relation with local environmental properties.
- Furthermore, the complex nature of the problem, its appeal for citizen scientists and the large data rates generated by existing and upcoming radio telescopes combine to make the morphological classification of radio sources an ideal test case for the application of machine learning techniques.
- One approach that has shown great promise recently is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Literature, however, lacks two major things when it comes to CNNs and radio galaxy morphological classification.
- Firstly, a proper analysis of whether overfitting occurs when training CNNs to perform radio galaxy morphological classification using a small curated training set is needed.
- Secondly, a good comparative study regarding the practical applicability of the CNN architectures in literature is required.
- Both of these shortcomings are addressed in this paper.
- Multiple performance metrics are used for the latter comparative study, such as inference time, model complexity, computational complexity and mean per class accuracy.
- As part of this study we also investigate the effect that receptive field, stride length and coverage has on recognition performance.
- For the sake of completeness, we also investigate the recognition performance gains that we can obtain by employing classification ensembles.
- A ranking system based upon recognition and computational performance is proposed.
- MCRGNet, Radio Galaxy Zoo and ConvXpress (novel classifier) are the architectures that best balance computational requirements with recognition performance.

##### [A direct and robust method to observationally constrain the halo mass function via the submillimeter magnification bias: Proof of concept](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03890) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03890.pdf)

- The main purpose of this work is to provide a method to derive tabulated observational constraints on the halo mass function (HMF) by studying the magnification bias effect on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies.
- Under the assumption of universality, we parametrize the HMF according to two traditional models, namely the Sheth and Tormen (ST) and Tinker fits and assess their performance in explaining the measured data within the {\Lambda} cold dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model.
- We also study the potential influence of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters in this analysis and discuss two important aspects regarding the HMF parametrization.
- Methods.
- We measure the cross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA galaxies with redshifts in the range $0.2<z<0.8$and a background sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with redshifts in the range $1.2<z<4.0$and carry out an MCMC algorithm to check this observable against its mathematical prediction within the halo model formalism.
- Results.
- If all HMF parameters are assumed to be positive, the ST fit only seems to fully explain the measurements by forcing the mean number of satellite galaxies in a halo to increase substantially from its prior mean value.
- The Tinker fit, on the other hand, provides a robust description of the data without relevant changes in the HOD parameters, but with some dependence on the prior range of two of its parameters.
- When the normalization condition for the HMF is dropped and we allow negative values of the $p_1$parameter in the ST fit, all the involved parameters are better determined, unlike the previous models, thus deriving the most general HMF constraints.
- While all cases are in agreement with the traditional fits within the uncertainties, the last one hints at a slightly higher number of halos at intermediate and high masses, raising the important point of the allowed parameter range.

##### [The physical properties of local (U)LIRGs: a comparison with nearby early- and late-type galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03913) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03913.pdf)

- In order to pinpoint the place of the (U)LIRGs in the local Universe we examine the properties of a sample of 67 such systems and compare them with those of 268 ETGs and 542 LTGs from the DustPedia database.
- We make use of multi-wavelength photometric data and the CIGALE SED fitting code to extract their physical parameters.
- The median SEDs as well as the values of the derived parameters were compared to those of the local ETGs and LTGs.
- In addition to that, (U)LIRGs were divided into seven classes, according to the merging stage of each system, and variations in the derived parameters were investigated.
- (U)LIRGs occupy the 'high-end' on the dust and stellar mass, and SFR in the local Universe with median values of 5.2$\times10^7~M_{\odot}$, 6.3$\times10^{10}~M_{\odot}$and 52$~M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, respectively.
- The PDR-dust emission in (U)LIRGs is 11.7% of the total dust luminosity, significantly higher than ETGs (1.6%) and the LTGs (5.2%).
- The median value of the dust temperature in (U)LIRGs is 32 K, which is higher compared to both the ETGs (28 K) and the LTGs (22 K).
- Small differences, in the derived parameters, are seen for the seven merging classes of our sample of (U)LIRGs with the most evident one being on the star-formation rate, where in systems in late merging stages the median SFR reaches up to 99 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$compared to 26 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$for the isolated ones.
- In contrast to the local normal galaxies where old stars dominate the stellar emission, the young stars in (U)LIRGs contribute with 64% of their luminosity to the total stellar luminosity.
- The fraction of the dust-absorbed stellar luminosity is extremely high in (U)LIRGs (78%) compared to 7% and 25% in ETGs and ETGs, respectively.
- The fraction of the stellar luminosity used to heat up the dust grains is very high in (U)LIRGs, while 74% of the dust emission comes from the young stars.

##### [Galaxy Lookback Evolution Models - a Comparison with Magneticum Cosmological Simulations and Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04135) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04135.pdf)

- We construct empirical models of star-forming galaxy evolution assuming that individual galaxies evolve along well-known scaling relations between stellar mass, gas mass and star formation rate following a simple description of chemical evolution.
- We test these models by a comparison with observations and with detailed Magneticum high resolution hydrodynamic cosmological simulations.
- Galaxy star formation rates, stellar masses, gas masses, ages, interstellar medium and stellar metallicities are compared.
- It is found that these simple lookback models capture many of the crucial aspects of galaxy evolution reasonably well.
- Their key assumption of a redshift dependent power law relationship between galaxy interstellar medium gas mass and stellar mass is in agreement with the outcome of the complex Magneticum simulations.
- Star formation rates decline towards lower redshift not because galaxies are running out of gas, but because the fraction of the cold ISM gas, which is capable of producing stars, becomes significantly smaller.
- Gas accretion rates in both model approaches are of the same order of magnitude.
- Metallicity in the Magneticum simulations increases with the ratio of stellar mass to gas mass as predicted by the lookback models.
- The mass metallicity relationships agree and the star formation rate dependence of these relationships is also reproduced.
- We conclude that these simple models provide a powerful tool for constraining and interpreting more complex models based on cosmological simulations and for population synthesis studies analyzing integrated spectra of stellar populations.

- We investigate how different galaxy properties - luminosities in u, g, r, J, K-bands, stellar mass, star formation rate and specific star formation rate trace the environment in the local universe.
- We also study the effect of survey flux limits on galaxy clustering measurements.
- We measure the two-point correlation function (2pCF) and marked correlation functions (MCFs) using the aforementioned properties as marks.
- We use nearly stellar-mass-complete galaxy sample in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.16 from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey with a flux limit of r < 19.8.
- Further, we impose a brighter flux limit of r < 17.8 to our sample and repeat the measurements to study how this affects galaxy clustering analysis.
- We compare our results to measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with flux limits of r < 17.8 and r < 16.8.
- We show that the stellar mass is the best tracer of galaxy environment, the K-band luminosity being a good substitute, although such a proxy sample misses close pairs of evolved, red galaxies.
- We also confirm that the u-band luminosity is a good, but not a perfect proxy of star formation rate in the context of galaxy clustering.
- We observe an effect of the survey flux limit on clustering studies - samples with a higher flux limit (smaller magnitude) miss some information about close pairs of starburst galaxies.

- From Rybicki's analysis using the Fourier slice theorem, mathematically it is possible to reproduce uniquely an edge-on axisymmetric galaxy's 3D light distribution from its 2D surface brightness.
- Utilizing galaxies from a cosmological simulation, we examine the ability of Syer and Tremaine's made-to-measure method and Schwarzschild's method for stellar dynamical modeling to do so for edge-on oblate axisymmetric galaxies.
- Overall, we find that the methods do not accurately recover the 3D distributions, with the made-to-measure method producing more accurate estimates than Schwarzschild's method.
- Our results have implications broader than just luminosity density, and affect other luminosity-weighted distributions within galaxies, for example, age and metallicity.

##### [Simulating the transport of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields injected by radio galaxies in the intracluster medium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04193) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04193.pdf)

- Radio galaxies play an important role in the seeding of cosmic rays and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.
- Here, we simulate the evolution of relativistic electrons injected into the intracluster medium by radio galaxies.
- Using passive tracer particles added to magnetohydrodynamical adaptive-mesh simulations, we calculate the evolution of the spectrum of relativistic electrons taking into account energy losses and re-acceleration mechanisms associated with the dymamics of the intracluster medium.
- Re-acceleration can occur at shocks via diffusive shock acceleration, and in turbulent flows via second-order Fermi re-acceleration.
- Relativistic electrons from radio galaxies are found to fill the intracluster medium over scales of several $100 \rm ~Myr$, and they create a stable reservoir of fossil electrons which remains available for further re-acceleration by shock waves and turbulent gas motions.
- In the near future, deep radio observations (especially at low frequencies) are likely to probe such mechanisms in galaxy clusters.

##### [An Unbiased Estimator of the Full-sky CMB Angular Power Spectrum using Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04327) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04327.pdf)

- Accurate estimation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) angular power spectrum is enticing due to the prospect for precision cosmology it presents.
- Galactic foreground emissions, however, contaminate the CMB signal and need to be subtracted reliably in order to lessen systematic errors on the CMB temperature estimates.
- Typically bright foregrounds in a region lead to further uncertainty in temperature estimates in the area even after some foreground removal technique is performed and hence determining the underlying full-sky angular power spectrum poses a challenge.
- We explore the feasibility of utilizing artificial neural networks to predict the angular power spectrum of the full sky CMB temperature maps from the observed angular power spectrum of the partial sky in which CMB temperatures in some bright foreground regions are masked.
- We present our analysis at large angular scales with two different masks.
- We produce unbiased predictions of the full-sky angular power spectrum and the underlying theoretical power spectrum using neural networks.
- Our predictions are also uncorrelated to a large extent.
- We further show that the multipole-multipole covariances of the predictions of the full-sky spectra made by the ANNs are much smaller than those of the estimates obtained using the method of pseudo-$C_l$.

- We study the bar instability in collisionless, rotating, anisotropic, stellar systems, using N-body simulations and also the matrix technique for calculation of modes with the perturbed collisionless Boltzmann equation.
- These methods are applied to spherical systems with an initial Plummer density distribution, but modified kinematically in two ways: the velocity distribution is tangentially anisotropic, using results of Dejonghe, and the system is set in rotation by reversing the velocities of a fraction of stars in various regions of phase space, a la Lynden-Bell.
- The aim of the N-body simulations is first to survey the parameter space, and, using those results, to identify regions of phase space (by radius and orbital inclination) which have the most important influence on the bar instability.
- The matrix method is then used to identify the resonant interactions in the system which have the greatest effect on the growth rate of a bar.
- Complementary series of N-body simulations examine these processes in relation to the evolving frequency distribution and the pattern speed.
- Finally, the results are synthesised with an existing theoretical framework, and used to consider the old question of constructing a stability criterion.

- In this study, we use the SWIFT/BAT AGN sample, which has received extensive multiwavelength follow-up analysis as a result of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), to develop a diagnostic for nuclear obscuration by examining the relationship between the line-of-sight column densities ($N_{\rm{H}}$), the 2-10 keV-to-$12 \rm{\mu m}$luminosity ratio, and WISE mid-infrared colors.
- We demonstrate that heavily obscured AGNs tend to exhibit both preferentially ''redder'' mid-infrared colors and lower values of $L_{\rm{X, Obs.
- }}$/$L_{12 \rm{\mu m}}$than less obscured AGNs, and we derive expressions relating $N_{\rm{H}}$to the $L_{\rm{X, Obs.
- }}$/$L_{12 \rm{\mu m}}$and $L_{22 \rm{\mu m}}$/$L_{4.6 \rm{\mu m}}$luminosity ratios as well as develop diagnostic criteria using these ratios.
- Our diagnostic regions yield samples that are $\gtrsim80$% complete and $\gtrsim60$% pure for AGNs with log($N_{\rm{H}})\geq24$, as well as $\gtrsim85$% pure for AGNs with $\rm{log}(N_{\rm{H}})\gtrsim23.5$.
- We find that these diagnostics cannot be used to differentiate between optically star forming galaxies and active galaxies.
- Further, mid-IR contributions from host galaxies that dominate the observed $12~\rm{\mu m}$emission can lead to larger apparent X-ray deficits and redder mid-IR colors than the AGNs would intrinsically exhibit, though this effect helps to better separate less obscured and more obscured AGNs.
- Finally, we test our diagnostics on two catalogs of AGNs and infrared galaxies, including the XMM-Newton XXL-N field, and we identify several known Compton-thick AGNs as well as a handful of candidate heavily obscured AGNs based upon our proposed obscuration diagnostics.

- We study the innermost jet morphology and magnetic field strength in the AGN 3C 345 with an unprecedented resolution using images obtained within the framework of the key science programme on AGN polarisation of the Space VLBI mission RadioAstron.
- Methods.
- We observed the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 345 at 1.6 GHz on 2016 March 30 with RadioAstron and 18 ground-based radio telescopes in full polarisation mode.
- Results.
- Our images, in both total intensity and linear polarisation, reveal a complex jet structure at 300 $\mu$as angular resolution, corresponding to a projected linear scale of about 2 pc or a few thousand gravitational radii.
- We identify the synchrotron self-absorbed core at the jet base and find the brightest feature in the jet 1.5 mas downstream of the core.
- Several polarised components appear in the Space VLBI images that cannot be seen from ground array-only images.
- Except for the core, the electric vector position angles follow the local jet direction, suggesting a magnetic field perpendicular to the jet.
- This indicates the presence of plane perpendicular shocks in these regions.
- Additionally, we infer a minimum brightness temperature at the largest $(u,v)$-distances of $1.1\times 10^{12}$K in the source frame, which is above the inverse Compton limit and an order of magnitude larger than the equipartition value.
- This indicates locally efficient injection or re-acceleration of particles in the jet to counter the inverse Compton cooling or the geometry of the jet creates significant changes in the Doppler factor, which has to be $>11$to explain the high brightness temperatures.

##### [How Many Elements Matter?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04992) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04992.pdf)

- #ssst/mw #machine_learning [[ML - Normalizing Flows]]
- We adopt a technique known as normalizing flow to reconstruct the probability distribution of Milky Way disk stars in the space of 15 elemental abundances measured by APOGEE.
- After conditioning on [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], the residual scatter for the best measured APOGEE elements is $\sigma_{[X/{\rm H}]} \lesssim 0.02$dex, consistent with APOGEE's reported statistical uncertainties of $\sim 0.01 - 0.015$dex and intrinsic scatter of $0.01-0.02$dex.
- Despite the small scatter, residual abundances display clear correlations between elements, which are too large to be explained by measurement uncertainties or by the statistical noise from our finite sample size.
- We must condition on at least seven elements (e.g., Fe, Mg, O, Si, Ni, Ca, Al) to reduce residual correlations to a level consistent with observational uncertainties, and higher measurement precision for other elements would likely reveal additional dimensions.
- We conclude that many elements have an independent story to tell, even for a "mundane" sample of disk stars and elements produced mainly by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae.

- #galaxy/spop #galaxy/simulation #stellar_population 
- We elucidate two definitions - termed 'mean' and 'galactic' $\alpha$-enhancement - in more detail.
	- While a star-forming galaxy has a high 'mean' $\alpha$-enhancement when its stars formed rapidly, a galaxy with a large 'galactic' $\alpha$-enhancement generally had a delayed star formation history.
- We find that absorption-line strengths of Mg and Fe correlate with variations in $\alpha$-enhancement.
	- These correlations are strongest for the 'galactic' $\alpha$-enhancement.
	- 但在SF星系中年龄的变化极大的影响了alpha/Fe的测量
- The ambiguity is not severe for passive galaxies and we confirm that spectral variations in these galaxies are caused by measurable variations in $\alpha$-enhancements.

- We combine a semi-numerical He II reionization model, hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with ionizing radiative transfer, and a novel statistical framework to infer the QLD from an ensemble of proximity zone measurements.

- The CF is converted from a ratio of infrared (IR) luminosity contributed from AGN dust torus ($L_{\rm IR}^{\rm torus}$) and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$), by assuming a non-linear relation between luminosity ratio and intrinsic CF.
	- As a result, anti-correlations for CF-$L_{\rm bol}$, CF-$M_{\rm BH}$, and CF-$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$are confirmed.

	- We also detect an excess of X-ray emission, relatively hotter than that of the surroundings, towards the south, at $\sim$25\arcsec (88 kpc) from the core of the cluster, indicating the existence of an in-falling galaxy group.
	- The radio lobes are responsible for the observed X-ray cavities detected in this system.
- The lower values of mid-IR WISE color [W1-W2] and [W2-W3] imply that the central BCG of Abell~3017 is a star-forming galaxy.

	- The $R_{\rm in, t}$from the TO model does not agree with the NIR observations ($\sim 0.04$pc).

- The cross-correlations constrain the quantity $\Omega_{{HI}} b_{{HI}} r_{{HI},{opt}}$at an effective scale $k_{eff}$, where $\Omega_{HI}$is the HI density fraction, $b_{HI}$is the HI bias, and $r_{{HI},{opt}}$the galaxy-hydrogen correlation coefficient, which is dependent on the HI content of the optical galaxy sample.

- We report the discovery of diffuse extended Ly-alpha emission from redshift 3.1 to 4.5, tracing cosmic web filaments on scales of 2.5-4 comoving Mpc.
- These structures have been observed in overdensities of Ly-alpha emitters in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field
- Remarkably, 70% of the total Ly-alpha luminosity from these filaments comes from beyond the circumgalactic medium of any identified Ly-alpha emitters.
- Fluorescent Ly-alpha emission powered by the cosmic UV background can only account for less than 34% of this emission at z$\approx$3 and for not more than 10% at higher redshift.
- We find that the bulk of this diffuse emission can be reproduced by the unresolved Ly-alpha emission of a large population of ultra low luminosity Ly-alpha emitters ($\mathrm{<10^{40} erg s^{-1}}$), provided that the faint end of the Ly-alpha luminosity function is steep ($\alpha \lessapprox -1.8$), it extends down to luminosities lower than $\mathrm{10^{38} - 10^{37} erg s^{-1}}$and the clustering of these Ly-alpha emitters is significant (filling factor $< 1/6$).
- If these Ly-alpha emitters are powered by star formation, then this implies their luminosity function needs to extend down to star formation rates $\mathrm{< 10^{-4} M_\odot yr^{-1}}$.

- While there are other possibilities, i.e, X-ray binary or supernova shock, the results from optical spectropolarimetry analysis are consistent with the presence of an additional AGN, which likely originates from a minor merger.

- 关键条件 i.e strong halo clustering and high star formation rates, are crucial to produce a non-negligible number of massive seed BH host candidates: we find $\approx1400$dynamically heated metal-free mini-haloes, including one of these which evolves to a synchronised pair and ends up in the massive quasar-host halo by $z=6$.
- Our results further suggest that multiple massive seed BHs may form in or near the quasar host's progenitors, potentially merging at lower redshifts and yielding gravitational wave events.

- This interaction is generally thought of as a contact force per area, however we point out that these gases must interact in a hydrodynamic fashion, and argue that this will lead to mixing of the galactic gas with the ICM wind.
	- We develop an analytic framework for how mixing is related to the acceleration of stripped gas from a satellite galaxy.
- Focusing on the dense clumps in the stripped tails, we find that they are nearly uniformly mixed with the ICM, indicating that all gas in the tail mixes with the surroundings, and dense clumps are not separate entities to be modeled differently than diffuse gas.
- We find that while mixing drives acceleration of stripped gas, the density and velocity of the surrounding wind will determine whether the mixing results in the heating of stripped gas into the ICM, or the cooling of the ICM into dense clouds.

##### [Pair Lines of Sight Observations of Multiphase Gas Bearing O VI in a Galaxy Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05065) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05065.pdf)

- Using $HST$/COS observations of the twin quasar lines of sight Q$0107-025$A $\&$Q$0107-025$B, we report on the physical properties, chemical abundances and transverse sizes of gas in a multiple galaxy environment at $z = 0.399$across a transverse separation of $520$kpc.
- The absorber towards Q$0107-025$B has $\log N(H I)/cm^{-2} \approx 16.8$(partial Lyman limit) while the absorber towards the other sightline has $N(H I) \approx 2$dex lower.
- The O VI along both sightlines have comparable column densities and broad $b$-values, whereas the low ionization lines are considerably narrower.
- The low ionization gas is inconsistent with the O VI when modelled assuming photoionization in a single phase.
- Along both the lines-of-sight, O VI and coinciding broad H I are best explained through collisional ionization in a cooling plasma with solar metallicity.
- Ionization models infer $1/10$-th solar metallicity for the pLLS and solar metallicity for the lower column density absorber along the other sightline.
- Within $\pm~250~km~s^{-1}$and $2$Mpc of projected distance from the sightlines 12 galaxies are identified, of which 3 are within $300$kpc.
- One of them is a dwarf galaxy while the other two are intermediate mass systems at impact parameters of $\rho \sim (1-4)R_{vir}$.
- The O VI along both lines-of-sight could be either tracing narrow transition temperature zones at the interface of low ionization gas and the hot halo of nearest galaxy, or a more spread-out warm gas bound to the circumgalactic halo/intragroup medium.
- This latter scenario leads to a warm gas mass limit of $M \gtrsim 4.5 \times 10^{9}$M$_\odot$.

- MUSE观测：We measured flat and sometimes inverted oxygen abundance gradients in the subsystems composing NGC 1487, explained by metal mixing processes common in merging galaxies.
- The kinematic map revealed a rotating pattern in the gas in the northern tail of the system, suggesting that the galaxy may be in the process of rebuilding a disc.
- The gas located in the central region has larger velocity dispersion ($\sigma\approx 50$km s$^{-1}$) than the remaining regions, indicating kinematic heating, possibly owing to the ongoing interaction.
- Based on all our measurements and findings, and specially on the mass estimates, metallicity gradients and velocity fields of the system, we propose that NGC 1487 is the result of an ongoing merger event involving smallish dwarf galaxies within a group, in a pre-merger phase, resulting in a relic with mass and physical parameters similar to a dwarf galaxy.

- We use a sample of 18 UFDs to place the strongest constraints to date on the mass of the FDM particle, updating on previous bounds using a subset of the sample used here.
	- We find that most of the sample UFDs prefer a FDM particle mass heavier than $10^{-21}\mathrm{eV}$.

- Here we present submillimeter observations (with spatial resolution of 700 parsecs) of ALESS 073.1, a starburst galaxy at redshift z~5, when the Universe was 1.2 billion years old.
	- This galaxy's cold gas forms a regularly rotating disk with negligible noncircular motions.

- We explore the kinematics of 27 z~6 quasar host galaxies observed in [CII]-158 micron ([CII]) emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array at a resolution of ~0.25''.
	- We find that nine of the galaxies show disturbed [CII] emission, either due to a close companion galaxy or recent merger.
	- Ten galaxies have smooth velocity gradients consistent with the emission arising from a gaseous disk.
	- The remaining eight quasar host galaxies show no velocity gradient, suggesting that the gas in these systems is dispersion-dominated.
	- All galaxies show high velocity dispersions with a mean of 129+-10 km/s.
- Comparison between the dynamical mass and the mass of the supermassive black hole reveals that the sample falls above the locally derived bulge mass--black hole mass relation at 2.4sigma significance.
- Using several different estimators for the molecular mass, we estimate a gas mass fraction of >10%, indicating gas makes up a large fraction of the baryonic mass of z~6 quasar host galaxies.

##### [The Physics of Galactic Winds Driven by Cosmic Rays I: Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05696) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05696.pdf)

- We elucidate the physics of CR-driven galactic winds for CR transport dominated by diffusion.
	- We use analytic estimates validated by time-dependent spherically-symmetric simulations to derive expressions for the mass-loss rate, momentum flux, and speed of CR-driven galactic winds, suitable for cosmological-scale or semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.
- For CR diffusion coefficients $\kappa \gtrsim r_0 c_i$where $r_0$is the base radius of the wind and $c_i$is the isothermal gas sound speed, the asymptotic wind energy flux is comparable to that supplied to CRs, and the outflow rapidly accelerates to supersonic speeds.
- By contrast, for $\kappa \lesssim r_0 c_i$, CR-driven winds accelerate more slowly and lose most of their energy to gravity, a CR analogue of photon-tired stellar winds.
- Given CR diffusion coefficients estimated using Fermi gamma-ray observations of pion decay, we predict mass-loss rates in CR-driven galactic winds of order the star formation rate for dwarf and disc galaxies.
- The dwarf galaxy mass-loss rates are small compared to the mass-loadings needed to reconcile the stellar and dark matter halo mass functions.
- For nuclear starbursts (e.g., M82, Arp 220), CR diffusion and pion losses suppress the CR pressure in the galaxy and the strength of CR-driven winds.

- 1. The broad line region (BLR) and continuum polarization are both produced by a single scattering medium.
- 2. The scattering medium is equatorial, and at right angle to the system axis.
- 3. The scattering medium is located at or just outside the BLR.
- The observed line width is found to be affected by inclination, which can lead to an underestimate of the black hole mass by a factor of $\sim 5$for a close-to face-on view.
	- The line width measured in the polarized flux overcomes the inclination bias, and provides a close-to equatorial view of the BLR in all AGN, which allows to reduce the inclination bias in the BLR based black hole mass estimates.

- #galaxy/spop #stellar_population #survey/manga
- We study a large sample of 1900 galaxies spanning $8.6 - 11.3 \log M/M_{\odot}$in stellar mass, through key absorption features in stacked spectra from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey.
- We find flat age and negative metallicity gradients for ETGs and negative age and negative metallicity gradients for LTGs.
- Age gradients in LTGs steepen with increasing galaxy mass, from $-0.05\pm0.11~\log$Gyr/R$_e$for the lowest mass galaxies to $-0.82\pm0.08~\log$Gyr/R$_e$for the highest mass ones. This strong gradient-mass relation has a slope of $-0.70\pm0.18$.
- Comparing local age and metallicity gradients with the velocity dispersion $\sigma$within galaxies against the global relation with $\sigma$shows that internal processes regulate metallicity in ETGs but not age, and vice versa for LTGs.
- Both galaxy types display flat [C/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], and negative [Na/Fe] gradients, whereas only LTGs display gradients in [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe].
- ETGs have increasingly steep [Na/Fe] gradients with local $\sigma$reaching $6.50\pm0.78$dex/$\log$km/s for the highest masses.

- From these data, local density remains the primary factor with a secondary role for distance from the inferred center of the entire structure's potential well.
- We see changes in lower-mass galaxies (M $<$$10^{10.5}$$M_{sun}$) at four times the virial radius of major substructures, while the more massive $NUV$Green Valley galaxies show low levels of star formation within two virial radii.
	- Suppression of star formation ("quenching") occurs in the infall regions of these structures even before galaxies enter the denser group environment.

- #cluster/halo #strong_lensing 
- Here, we evaluate the use of a Single-Halo model (SHM) as an efficient method to estimate the strong lensing cluster core mass, testing it with ray-traced images from the 'Outer Rim' simulation.
- We find that the projected core mass estimated with this method, M$_{\rm SHM}$, has a scatter of $8.52\%$and a bias of $0.90\%$compared to the "true" mass within the same aperture.
- We find that the SHM success depends on the lensing geometry, with single giant arc configurations accounting for most of the failed cases due to their limiting constraining power.
- Finally, we find that when the source redshift is unknown, the model-predicted redshifts are overestimated, and the M$_{\rm SHM}$is underestimated by a few percent, highlighting the importance of securing spectroscopic redshifts of background sources.

- Within a $\sim\!3$kpc radius, we find two temperature components with statistical significance.

- Over time negative radial gradients of abundance become steeper while azimuthal variations become weaker (more homogeneous).
- Furthermore, elemental abundances are measurably homogeneous (to $\lesssim 0.05$dex) across a radial range of $\Delta R \approx 3.5$kpc at $z \gtrsim 1$and $\Delta R \approx 1.7$kpc at $z = 0$.
- We also measure full distributions of elemental abundances, finding typically negatively skewed normal distributions at $z \gtrsim 1$that evolve to typically Gaussian distributions by $z = 0$.

- #machine_learning 
- Wide-field sub-millimetre surveys have driven many major advances in galaxy evolution in the past decade, but without extensive follow-up observations the coarse angular resolution of these surveys limits the science exploitation.
- Here we present an autoencoder with a novel loss function to overcome this problem in the sub-millimeter wavelength range.
- This approach is successfully demonstrated on Herschel SPIRE COSMOS data, with the super-resolving target being the JCMT SCUBA-2 observations of the same field.

- Characterization of the relations between star-formation rate, stellar mass and molecular gas mass surface densities at different spatial scales across galaxies (from galaxy wide to kpc-scales).
	- Those relations are the same at the different explored scales, sharing the same distributions for the explored data

- In this pilot study, we investigate the use of a deep learning (DL) model to temporally evolve the dynamics of gas accreting onto a black hole in the form of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF).
- We have trained a machine to forecast such a spatiotemporally chaotic system -- i.e black hole weather forecasting -- using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a training dataset which consists of numerical solutions of the hydrodynamical equations, for a range of initial conditions.

- It has been claimed in the literature that a galaxy's dust temperature -- observed as the wavelength where the dust SED peaks ($\lambda_{peak}$) -- is traced most closely by its specific star-formation rate (sSFR) or parameterized 'distance' to the SFR-M$_\star$relation (the galaxy 'main sequence').
- We conclude that the more fundamental tracer of galaxies' luminosity-weighted integrated dust temperatures are indeed their star-formation surface densities in line with local Universe results, which relate closely to the underlying geometry of dust in the ISM.

- SPHERE/VLT观测NGC1068
- We are able to separate the dominant polarising mechanisms in the three regions of the ionisation cone, the extended envelop of the torus and the very central bright source of the AGN.
	- Dichroic absorption is estimated to be responsible for about 99 % of the polarised flux coming from the photo-centre.
- However, this contribution would be restricted to this location only, double scattering process being the most important contributor to polarisation in the equatorial plane of the AGN and single scattering being dominant in the polar outflow bi-cone.

- We reconstruct the gamma-ray image of M31 in a template-independent way, and we show that flat spatial models are preferred by data, indicating an extension of the $\gamma$-ray emission of about 0.3-0.4 degree for the bulge of M31.

- We present the first high-resolution and high-sensitivity polarimetry study of the merging galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 in the 1-4 GHz frequency band.
- For the first time in a radio relic, we observe a decreasing polarization fraction in the downstream region.
	- Possibly explained by geometrical projections and/or by decreasing of the magnetic field anisotropy towards the cluster center.
- From the amount of depolarization of the only detected background radio galaxy, we estimate a turbulent magnetic field strength of $B_{\rm turb}\sim5.6~\mu$Gauss in the relic.

- Constrain the redshift dependence of gas pressure bias $\left\langle b_{y} P_{\mathrm{e}}\right\rangle$(bias-weighted average electron pressure), which characterises the thermodynamics of intergalactic gas
	- With these measurements, combining galaxy-tSZ and galaxy-CMB lensing cross-correlations allows us to break the degeneracy between galaxy bias and gas pressure bias, and hence constrain them simultaneously.
- In all redshift bins, the best-fit values of $\left\langle b_{y} P_{\mathrm{e}}\right\rangle$are at a level of $\sim 0.3 \mathrm{meV/cm^3}$and increase slightly with redshift.
- This study demonstrates the feasibility of using CMB lensing to calibrate the galaxy distribution such that the galaxy distribution can be used as a mass proxy without relying on the precise knowledge of the matter distribution.

	- Finally, we develop a new machine learning approach for converting between metallicity calibrations.
- The random forest method yields the same accuracy as the (updated) polynomial conversions, but has the significant advantage that a single model can be applied over a wide range of metallicities, without the need to distinguish upper and lower branches in $R_{23}$calibrations.
- The trained random forest is made publicly aailable for use in the community.

	- (1) subhalos with masses less than $10^8 M_{\odot}$negligibly affect test particle orbits
	- (2) perturbations lead to orbital deviations only in environments with substructure fractions $f_{sub} \geq 1\%$
	- (3) perturbations from denser subhalos produce larger orbital deviations
	- (4) subhalo perturbations that are strong relative to the background tidal field lead to larger orbital deviations.
- Finally, we conclude that clusters that orbit within 100 kpc of Milky Way-like galaxies experience a change no greater than $2\%$in their dissolution times.

- HST/COS观测Stephan's Quintet: spectroscopy along five lines-of-sight, probing 1 kpc-diameter regions in the IGM, reveals very broad (~2000 km/s) and powerful Ly$\alpha$line emission with complex line shapes.
	- These Lyman-alpha line profiles are often similar to, or sometimes much broader than line profiles obtained in H$\beta$, [CII], and CO (1-0) emission along the same lines-of-sight.
	- 起源应该是共振散射; 有些是从低消光区域散射出来的；有些经过了吸收
	- Scattering indicates that the neutral gas of the IGM is clumpy, with multiple clumps along a given line of sight.
- We suggest that both shocks and mixing layers co-exist and contribute to the energy dissipation associated with a turbulent energy cascade.
	- This may be important for the cooling of gas at higher redshifts, where the metal content is lower than in this local system, and a high amplitude of turbulence more common.

- A novel aspect of this work is the inclusion of nonlinear triangle configurations for the bispectrum, made possible by a complete next-to-leading order ("one-loop") description of galaxy bias, as is already common practice for the power spectrum.
- Based on the goodness-of-fit and the unbiasedness of the parameter posteriors, we accomplish a stringent validation of this model compared to the leading order ("tree-level") bispectrum.
- Besides, our precise measurements of galaxy bias parameters up to fourth order allow for thorough comparisons to coevolution relations, showing excellent agreement for all contributions generated by the nonlocal action of gravity.

- We show that the mass and radial profile of a progenitor dwarf galaxy evolved along the orbit of the Orphan Stream, including the stellar and dark matter components, can be reconstructed from the distribution of stars in the tidal stream it produced.
- The parameters are recovered even though the dark matter component extends well past the half light radius of the dwarf galaxy progenitor, proving that we are able to extract information about the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies from the tidal debris.
- This method can be used to estimate the dark matter content in dwarf galaxies without the assumption of virial equilibrium that is required to estimate the mass using line-of-sight velocities.

- We utilize multi-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging data to classify each Chandra-detected compact X-ray source as a low-mass (i.e donor mass <~ 3 solar masses), high-mass (donor mass >~ 8 solar masses) or intermediate-mass XRB based on either the location of its candidate counterpart on optical color-magnitude diagrams or the age of its host star cluster.
	- We identify a marginally significant (at the 1-to-2 sigma level) exponential downturn for the high-mass XRB XLF, at logLx ~ 38.48^{+0.52}_{-0.33} (in log CGS units).
	- In contrast, the low- and intermediate-mass XRB XLFs, as well as the total XLF of M83, are formally consistent with sampling statistics from a single power-law.
- Our method suggests a non-negligible contribution from low- and possibly intermediate-mass XRBs to the total XRB XLF of M83, i.e between 20 and 50%, in broad agreement with X-ray based XLFs.
- More generally, we caution against considerable contamination from X-ray emitting supernova remnants to the published, X-ray based XLFs of M83, and possibly all actively star-forming galaxies.

- I report a tentative ($\sim4\sigma$) emission line at $\nu=100.84 $GHz from "COS-3mm-1'", a 3mm-selected galaxy reported by Williams et al 2019 that is undetected at optical and near infrared wavelengths.
- Assuming the line corresponds to the $\rm CO(6\to5)$transition, this tentative detection implies a spectroscopic redshift of $z=5.857$, in agreement with the galaxy's redshift constraints from multi-wavelength photometry.
- This would make this object the highest redshift 3mm-selected galaxy and one of the highest redshift dusty star-forming galaxies known to-date.
- Interestingly, “MAMBO-9”, another DSFGs ∼ 0.5 deg away from the source studied in this work (equivalent to around 10 Mpc), lies at z = 5.850 (Casey et al. 2019). The confirmation of more galaxies with similar redshifts within this region of the sky might imply the existence of a large-scale galaxy proto-cluster structure.

- Combining our results with an earlier z~10 LF determination by Oesch+2018a, we quantify the evolution of the $UV$LF.
	- (1) a smooth flattening of the faint-end slope alpha from alpha~-2.4 at z~10 to -1.5 at z~2
	- (2) minimal evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* at z>~2.5
	- (3) a monotonic increase in the normalization log_10 phi* from z~10 to z~2, which can be well described by a simple second-order polynomial, consistent with an "accelerated" evolution scenario.

- This work addresses these questions by studying the link between X-ray, nuclear ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and extended ionised outflows, for the first time in two quasars close to the peak of AGN activity ($z\sim2$), where AGN feedback is expected to be more effective.
	- We selected two multiple-lensed quasars at $z\sim1.5$, HS 0810+2554 and SDSS J1353+1138, known to host UFOs
	- We detected spatially resolved ionised outflows in both galaxies, extended more than 8 kpc and moving up to $v>2000$km/s.
- Comparing with the co-hosted UFO energetics, the ionised outflow energetics in HS 0810+2554 is broadly consistent with a momentum-driven regime of wind propagation, while in SDSS J1353+1138 it differs by a factor of $\sim$100 from theoretical predictions, requiring either a massive molecular outflow or a high variability of the AGN activity to account for such a discrepancy.
- We found that in 10 out of 12 galaxies the large-scale outflow energetics is consistent with the theoretical predictions of either a momentum- or an energy-driven scenario.

- We present ~0.15'' spatial resolution imaging of SHiZELS-14, a massive (M*~10^11 M_sol), dusty, star-forming galaxy at z=2.24. SHiZELS-14 displays a compact, dusty central starburst, as well as extended emission in $\rm{H}\alpha$and the rest-frame optical and FIR.
- The UV emission is spatially offset from the peak of the dust continuum emission, and appears to trace holes in the dust distribution.
- We find that the dust attenuation varies across the spatial extent of the galaxy, reaching a peak of at least A_H-alpha~5 in the most dusty regions, although the extinction in the central starburst is likely to be much higher.
- Global star-formation rates inferred using standard calibrations for the different tracers vary from ~10-1000 M_sol/yr, and are particularly discrepant in the galaxy's dusty centre.
- This galaxy highlights the biased view of the evolution of star-forming galaxies provided by shorter wavelength data.

- For the classification of astronomical objects such as radio galaxies, which are expected statistically to be globally orientation invariant, this lack of dihedral equivariance means that a conventional CNN must learn explicitly to classify all rotated versions of a particular type of object individually.
	- We present the first application of group-equivariant convolutional neural networks to radio galaxy classification and explore their potential for reducing intra-class variability by preserving equivariance for the Euclidean group E(2), containing translations, rotations and reflections.
- For the radio galaxy classification problem considered here, we find that classification performance is modestly improved by the use of both cyclic and dihedral models without additional hyper-parameter tuning, and that a D16 equivariant model provides the best test performance.
- We use the Monte Carlo Dropout method as a Bayesian approximation to recover epistemic uncertainty as a function of image orientation and show that E(2)-equivariant models are able to reduce variations in model confidence as a function of rotation.

- By analysing 1000 Euclid-like light-cones, produced with the PINOCCHIO approximate method, we validate the analytical model of Hu & Kravtsov 2003 for the covariance matrix, which takes into account both sources of statistical error.
- The analytical covariance matrix reproduces the variance measured from simulations within the 10 per cent level; such difference has no sizeable effect on the error of cosmological parameter constraints at this level of statistics.
- Also, we find that the Gaussian likelihood with cosmology-dependent covariance is the only model that provides an unbiased inference of cosmological parameters without underestimating the errors.

##### [Testing the Turbulent Origin of the Stellar Initial Mass Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08564) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08564.pdf)

- #initial_mass_function 
- We test three turbulence-based IMF models (by Padoan & Nordlund 2002, Hennebelle & Chabrier 2008, and Hopkins 2012), which predict the relation between the high-mass slope ($\Gamma$) of the IMF, $\mathrm{d} N/\mathrm{d} \log M \propto M^{\Gamma}$and the exponent n of the velocity power spectrum of turbulence, $E_v(k)\propto k^{-n} $, where $n\approx 2$corresponds to typical ISM turbulence.
- Using hydrodynamic simulations, we drive turbulence with an unusual index of $n\approx 1$, measure $\Gamma$, and compare the results with $n\approx 2$.
- We conclude that turbulence plays a key role in shaping the IMF, with a shallower turbulence power spectrum producing a shallower high-mass IMF, and hence more massive stars.

- #cosmology #simulation 
- We present a two-dimensional (2D) Particle-Particle-Particle-Mesh (P$^3$M) algorithm with an optimized Green function and adaptive softening length for gravitational lensing studies in N-Body simulations.
- Our method is two orders of magnitude more accurate than the simple PM algorithm with the {\it poor man's} Green function ($\propto1/k^2$) at a scale of a few mesh cells or smaller.
- The Poisson noise can be suppressed by smoothing out the particle distribution, which can be achieved by simply choosing an adaptive softening length in the PP calculation.
- We provide a \textsc{python} implementation \texttt{P3Mlens} for this algorithm.

- TNG50; CGM around star-forming galaxies in $10^{11.5}-10^{12}\;M_{\odot}$ halos at $z\simeq1$:
	- MgII gas is a very good tracer of the cold CGM, which is accreting inwards at an inflow velocity of $\sim$50 km s$^{-1}$.
	- For sightlines aligned with the galaxy's major axis, we find that MgII absorption lines are kinematically shifted due to the cold CGM's significant corotation
- MgII absorption in higher-mass halos is stronger and broader than in lower-mass halos but has qualitatively similar kinematics.

- #cosmology
- Conventional estimators of the anisotropic power spectrum and two-point correlation function (2PCF) adopt the 'Yamamoto approximation', fixing the line-of-sight of a pair of galaxies to that of just one of its members.
- Whilst this is accurate only to first-order in the characteristic opening angle $\theta_\max$, it allows for efficient implementation via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs).
- Using newly derived infinite series expansions for spherical harmonics and Legendre polynomials, we construct estimators accurate to arbitrary order in $\theta_\max$, though note that the midpoint and bisector formalisms themselves differ at fourth order.

##### [Tree-ring structure of Galactic bar resonance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08388) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08388.pdf)

- Galaxy models have long predicted that galactic bars slow down by losing angular momentum to their postulated dark haloes.
- The slow-down of the bar thus results in a rising mean metallicity of trapped stars from the surface towards the centre of the resonance as the Galaxy's metallicity declines towards large radii.
- This argument, when applied to Solar neighbourhood stars, allows a novel precision measurement of the bar's current pattern speed $\Omega_p = 35.5 \pm 0.8$km/s/kpc, placing the corotation radius at $R_{CR} = 6.6 \pm 0.2$kpc.
	- With this pattern speed, the corotation resonance precisely fits the Hercules stream in agreement with kinematics.

- We demonstrate the robustness of our method by applying it to a set of standard tests from the cosmological radiative transfer comparison project of Iliev et al The SPH-M1RT scheme is well-suited for modelling situations in which numerous sources emit ionising radiation, such as cosmological simulations of galaxy formation or simulations of the interstellar medium.

- The projected flattening of the lensing galaxy and tides from neighboring galaxies both contribute to the potential's quadrupole.
- The position of the lensing galaxy resolves the distinct contributions of intrinsic ellipticity and tidal shear to that quadrupole.
	- Among 31 quadruply lensed quasars systems with statistically significant decompositions, 15 are either reliably ($2\sigma$) or provisionally ($1\sigma$) shear-dominated and 11 are either reliably or provisionally ellipticity-dominated.
- This observational result is strongly at variance with the ellipticity-dominated forecast of Oguri & Marshall (2010).

- Summary statistics of the likelihood, such as the Bayesian evidence, offer a principled way of comparing models and assessing tension between, or within, the results of physical experiments.
- Noisy realisations of the data induce scatter in these model comparison statistics.
- For a realistic case of cosmological inference from large-scale structure we show that the logarithm of the Bayes factor attains scatter of order unity, increasing significantly with stronger tension between the models under comparison.
- We develop an approximate procedure that quantifies the sampling distribution of the evidence at small additional computational cost and apply it to real data to demonstrate the impact of the scatter, which acts to reduce the significance of any model discrepancies.
- Data compression is highlighted as a potential avenue to suppressing noise in the evidence to negligible levels, with a proof of concept on Planck cosmic microwave background data.

- #simulation #cosmology/simulation 
- We examine how the range of scales in which the two-point correlation function is converged depends on the force softening length and whether it is held constant in comoving or proper coordinates.
	- We find that a proper softening that reaches roughly 1/30th of the inter-particle spacing by the end of the simulation resolves the same spatial and temporal scales as a comoving softening of the same length while using a third fewer time steps, for a range of scale factors typical to $\Lambda$CDM simulations.

- #cosmology
- We carry out cosmological N-body simulations where we systematically vary growth history at a fixed linear density field, or vary the power spectrum shape at a fixed growth history.
	- We show that the halo mass function generically depends on these quantities, thus showing a clear signal of non-universality.
- Most of this effect can be traced back to the way in which the same linear fluctuation grows differently into the nonlinear regime depending on details of its assembly history.
	- With these results, we propose a parameterization with explicit dependence on the linear growth rate and power spectrum shape.
- We employ this tool to improve the accuracy of so-called cosmology-rescaling methods and show they can deliver 2% accurate predictions for the halo mass function over the whole range of currently viable cosmologies.

	- The large stellar masses, large effective radii, and faint surface brightnesses suggest that the host galaxies of the most luminous quasars are mostly ellipticals.

- The high [O I]/[C II] ratios and the joint analysis with the previous detection of [N II] lines for both the QSO and the SMG suggest the presence of warm and dense neutral gas in these highly star-forming galaxies.
- There is a possible positive correlation between the [NII]122/205 line ratio and the [O I]/[C II] ratio when all local and high-z sources are taken into account, indicating that the denser the ionized gas, the denser and warmer the neutral gas (or vice versa).

- We develop a novel numerical technique to solve for the Biermann battery term in the Constrained Transport method, preserving both the zero divergence of the magnetic field and the absence of Biermann battery for isothermal flows.
- The structure-preserving nature of our numerical method turns out to be very important to minimise numerical errors during validation tests of the propagation of a Str\"omgren sphere and of a Sedov blast wave.
- We then use this new method to model the evolution of a 2.5 and 5 co-moving Mpc cosmological box with a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model within the RAMSES code.
- Contrary to previous findings, we show that three different Biermann battery channels emerge: the first one is associated with linear perturbations before the EoR, the second one is the classical Biermann battery associated with reionization fronts during the EoR, and the third one is associated with strong, supernova-driven outflows.
- While the two former channels generate spontaneously volume-filling magnetic fields with a strength on the order or below $10^{-20}$G, the latter, owing to the higher plasma temperature and a marginally-resolved turbulent dynamo, reaches a field strength as high as $10^{-18}$G in the intergalactic medium around massive haloes.

- #galaxy/metallicity
- We show that the same physical principles govern the shape of both: centrally-peaked metal production favours steeper gradients, and this steepening is diluted by the addition of metal-poor gas, which is supplied by inward advection for low-mass galaxies and by cosmological accretion for massive galaxies.
- The MZR and the MZGR both bend at galaxy stellar mass $\sim 10^{10} - 10^{10.5} \rm{M_{\odot}}$, and we show that this feature corresponds to the transition of galaxies from the advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated regime.
- We also find that both the MZR and MZGR strongly suggest that low-mass galaxies preferentially lose metals entrained in their galactic winds.
- While this metal-enrichment of the galactic outflows is crucial for reproducing both the MZR and the MZGR at the low-mass end, we show that the flattening of gradients in massive galaxies is expected regardless of the nature of their winds.

- #galaxy/high-z #galaxy/ism
- In this work, we explore the diversity of ionised gas kinematics (rotational velocity $v_{\phi}$and velocity dispersion $\sigma_g$) and gas-phase metallicity gradients at $0.1 \leq z \leq 2.5$using a compiled data set of 74 galaxies resolved with ground-based integral field spectroscopy.
- 观测：
	- We find that galaxies with the highest and the lowest $\sigma_g$have preferentially flat metallicity gradients, whereas those with intermediate values of $\sigma_g$show a large scatter in the metallicity gradients.
	- Additionally, steep negative gradients appear almost only in rotation-dominated galaxies ($v_{\phi}/\sigma_g > 1$), whereas most dispersion-dominated galaxies show flat gradients.
- 理论：
	- In the case of high $\sigma_g$, the inward radial advection of gas dominates over metal production and causes efficient metal mixing, thus giving rise to flat gradients.
	- For low $\sigma_g$, it is the cosmic accretion of metal-poor gas diluting the metallicity that gives rise to flat gradients.
	- Finally, the reason for intermediate $\sigma_g$showing the steepest negative gradients is that both inward radial advection and cosmic accretion are weak as compared to metal production, which leads to the creation of steeper gradients.
	- The larger scatter at intermediate $\sigma_g$may be due in part to preferential ejection of metals in galactic winds, which can decrease the strength of the production term.

- #galaxy/ism
- Extinction curves vary within the Milky Way, and there is no reason why, except by chance, either E(B-V) or A(V) would be the most physical measure of dust column density.
- In this paper, we utilize for the first time full extinction curves to 41 MW sightlines and find that the scatter between N(H) and extinction is minimized -- and the relation becomes linear -- for extinction at 2900 +/- 160 A. Scatter and nonlinearity increase at longer wavelengths and are especially large for near-IR extinction. 紫外的消光才是更好的尘埃探针
- We also find that the very large discrepancy between MW and SMC gas-to-dust ratios of 0.9 dex in N(H)/E(B-V) is reduced to 0.7 dex for far-UV extinction, which matches the difference in cosmic abundances of carbon between the two galaxies, and therefore confirms that N(C) is the preferred measure of the gas in the gas-to-dust ratio, even though it may not be a convenient one.

- #galaxy/dwarf #smbh
- We trace the evolution of off-center massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and show that the reason for off-center locations is mainly due to galaxy-galaxy mergers.
- We calculate dynamical timescales and show that off-center MBHs are unlikely to sink to their galaxys' centers within a Hubble time, due to the shape of the hosts' potential wells and low stellar densities.
- These wandering MBHs are unlikely to be detected electromagnetically, nor is there a measurable dynamical effect on the galaxy's stellar population.
- We conclude that off-center MBHs may be common in dwarfs, especially if the mass of the MBH is small or the stellar mass of the host galaxy is large.

- We find that, because of shear flow in the disk, transient arcs of gas (streams) naturally arise when turbulence is driven on large scales (up to $\sim4$~pc), as might occur when a supernova blast wave encounters the CND.
- Because energetic events arise naturally and often in the central parsecs of our Galaxy, this result suggests that the transient structures that characterize the CND do not imply that the CND itself is a transient structure.

- We present the first set of cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of galaxies including dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM).
- Central density profiles of simulated dwarfs become cuspy when $(\sigma/m)_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 0.1 {\rm cm^{2} g^{-1}}$(and $f_{\rm diss}=0.5$as fiducial).
- For our surveyed dSIDM parameters, halo masses and galaxy stellar masses do not show appreciable difference from CDM, but dark matter kinematics and halo concentrations/shapes can differ.

- The Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Age (LEDA) was designed to measure brightness temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background due to 21-cm absorption/emission by neutral hydrogen in the early Universe.
- We present a power spectrum of observations at 48 MHz ($z \approx 28$), and an analysis of the sensitivity of the OVRO-LWA telescope.
	- We conclude that our power spectrum is dominated by telescope thermal noise and systematic effects.
- We show that OVRO-LWA will then be able to detect theoretically predicted Ly-$\alpha$and X-ray peaks in 21-cm power spectra at Cosmic Dawn, according to theoretical models.

- #machine_learning 
- Quasars behind the Galactic plane (GPQs) are important astrometric references and useful probes of Milky Way gas.
- At the data level, to make a training set in which dataset shift is modeled, we synthesize quasars and galaxies behind the Galactic plane based on SDSS sources and Galactic dust map.
- At the algorithm level, to reduce the effect of class imbalance, we transform the three-class classification problem for stars, galaxies, and quasars to two binary classification tasks.

- #galaxy/ism
- We present optical longslit spectra for a subset of the xGASS and xCOLD GASS galaxies to investigate the correlation between radial metallicity profiles and cold gas content.
- 1. the local metallicity is correlated with the global HI mass fraction, which is in good agreement with previous results. A simple toy model suggests that this correlation points towards a 'local gas regulator model'; 
- 2. the primary driver of metallicity gradients appears to be stellar mass surface density (as a proxy for morphology).
- Our results suggest that local density and local HI mass fraction are drivers of chemical evolution and the gas-phase metallicity.

- CNM中HI比例应该有比较强的宇宙学演化
- We use results from a recent commissioning survey for intervening 21-cm absorbers with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) to construct a Bayesian statistical model of the $N_\mathrm{HI}$-weighted harmonic mean spin temperature ($T_\mathrm{s}$) at redshifts between $z = 0.37$and 1.0.
	- We find that $T_\mathrm{s} \leq 274$K with 95 per cent probability, suggesting that at these redshifts the typical HI gas in galaxies at equivalent DLA column densities may be colder than the Milky Way interstellar medium $(T_\mathrm{s,MW} \sim 300$K).

- The solar dipole signal, induced by the motion of the solar system with respect to the CMB, is a very efficient tool to calibrate a detector or a set of detectors with high accuracy.
- The stability of the solar dipole parameters is a powerful way to control the galactic foregrounds removal in the component separation process.
	- It is used to build a model for Spectral Energy Distribution spatial variations of the interstellar dust emission.
- The results of this work are: improved solar dipole parameters, a new interstellar dust model, and a large scale cosmological anisotropies map.

- To create such test scenarios, we measure and model the photometric properties of galaxy clusters and their sky environments from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data in two bins of cluster richness $\lambda\in[30; 45)$, $\lambda\in[45; 60)$and three bins in cluster redshift ($z\in[0.3; 0.35)$, $z\in[0.45; 0.5)$and $z\in[0.6; 0.65)$.
	- Using deep-field imaging data we extrapolate galaxy populations beyond the limiting magnitude of DES Y3 and calculate the properties of cluster member galaxies via statistical background subtraction.
- Synthetic galaxy clusters are generated from real observational data, and thus are independent from the assumptions inherent to cosmological simulations. 加入了ICL的模型

	- The values of $\hat{\Delta}=-13.5\pm4.7$km s$^{-1}$, $\hat{\Delta}=-12.5\pm5.1$km s$^{-1}$, and $\hat{\Delta}=-18.6\pm4.8$km s$^{-1}$for the BCG, X-ray and CG cases respectively broadly agree with the literature.
- The BCG centroid is deemed to be the most robust method in this analysis, due to no well defined central redshift when using an X-ray centroid, and CGs identified by redMaPPer with no associated spectroscopic redshift.

- #galaxy/ltg
- Using archival HST data, we obtain the photometric masses of the two clusters, $M=3\times 10^5$M$_\odot$and $M=1.7\times 10^6$M$_\odot$, their half-light radii, $R_{\rm eff}\sim4$pc and $R_{\rm eff} \sim 6$pc, and their projected distances from the photometric center of the galaxy (both $<22$pc).
- Varying some of the unknown clusters orbital parameters, we carry out several $N$-body simulations showing that the future evolution of these clusters will inevitably result in their merger.
- We also investigate the possibility to form a massive NSC in the center of the galaxy by this process.
	- Our analysis suggests that for low eccentricity orbits, and relatively long merger times, the final merged cluster is spherical in shape, with an effective radius of few parsecs and a mass within the effective radius of the order of $10^5 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$.
	- Because the central density of such a cluster is higher than that of the host galaxy, it is likely that this merger remnant could be the likely embryo of a future NSC.

- We present the integrated 3-point shear correlation function $i\zeta_{\pm}$-- a higher-order statistic of the cosmic shear field -- which can be directly estimated in wide-area weak lensing surveys without measuring the full 3-point shear correlation function, making this a practical and complementary tool to 2-point statistics for weak lensing cosmology.
	- We define it as the 1-point aperture mass statistic $M_{\mathrm{ap}}$measured at different locations on the shear field correlated with the corresponding local 2-point shear correlation function $\xi_{\pm}$.
- We find that the joint analysis of $\xi_{\pm}$and $i\zeta_{\pm}$has the potential to considerably improve parameter constraints from $\xi_{\pm}$alone, and can be particularly useful in improving the figure of merit of the dynamical dark energy equation of state parameters from cosmic shear data.

##### [Possible Evidence of a Universal Radio/X-ray Correlation in a near-Complete Sample of Hard X-ray Selected Seyfert Galaxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10578) [(PDF)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10578.pdf)

- Because the disc--jet coupling likely depends on various properties of sources probed, the sample control is always an important but challenging task.
- In this work, we re-analyzed the INTEGRAL hard X-ray-selected sample of Seyfert galaxies.
- We only consider sources that have measurements in black hole mass, and luminosities in radio and X-rays.
- Our sample includes 64 sources, consists of both bright AGNs and low-luminosity ones.
- We first find that, because of the similarity in the $L_{HX}/L_X$distribution, the X-ray origin of radio-loud Seyferts may be the same to that of radio-quiet ones, where we attribute to the hot accretion flow (or similarly, the corona).
- We then investigate the connections between luminosities in radio and X-rays.
- Since our sample suffers a selection bias of a black hole mass $M_{BH}$dependence on $L_X/L_{Edd}$, we focus on the correlation slope $\xi_X$between the radio (at 1.4 GHz) and X-ray luminosities in Eddington unit, i.e $(L_R/L_{Edd})\propto(L_X/L_{Edd})^{\xi_X}$.
- We classify the sources according to various properties, i.e 1) Seyfert classification, 2) radio loudness, and 3) radio morphology.
- We find that, despite these differences in classification, all the sources in our sample are consistent with a universal correlation slope $\xi_X$, with $\xi_X=0.77\pm0.10$.
- This is unexpected, considering various possible radio emitters in radio-quiet systems.
- For the jet interpretation, our result may suggest a common/universal but to be identified jet launching mechanism among all the Seyfert galaxies, while properties like black hole spin and magnetic field strength only play secondary roles.
- We further estimate the jet production efficiency $\eta_{jet}$of Seyfert galaxies, which is $\eta_{jet}\approx1.9^{+0.9}_{-1.5}\times10^{-4}$on average.
- We also find that $\eta_{jet}$increases as the system goes fainter.

- GMRT观测ULIRGS: Our aim is to resolve any core-jet structures or nuclear extensions and hence examine whether the ULIRGs are evolving into radio loud ellipticals.
	- Our deep, low frequency observations show marginal extension for only one source.
	- However, the integrated radio spectra of 9 ULIRGs show characteristics that are similar to that of GPS/CSS/CSO/young radio sources.
- Hence, we conclude that although most ULIRGs do not show kpc scale extended radio emission associated with nuclear activity, their radio spectral energy distributions do show signatures of young radio galaxies.

- We also perform a blind search for [CII]-bright galaxies that may have been missed by optical selections, resulting in an upper limit on the cumulative number density of [CII] sources with $L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}>2.0\times10^8$L$_{\odot}$($5\sigma $) to be less than $1.8\times10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-3}$(90% confidence level).
- At this luminosity depth and volume coverage, we present an observed evolution of the [CII] luminosity function from $z=6$-$8$to $z\sim0$by comparing the ASPECS measurement to literature results at lower redshift.

- #galaxy/simulaiton #galaxy/cgm
- Classifying accretion as ''hot'' or '' cold'' based on a temperature cut of $10^{5.5}{\rm K}$, we find that the covering fraction ($f_{\rm cov}$) of cold-mode accreting gas is significantly lower than the hot-mode, with $z=0$$f_{\rm cov}$values of $\approx 50\%$and $\approx 80\%$respectively.
- Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback in EAGLE reduces inflow $f_{\rm cov}$values by $\approx 10\%$, with outflows decreasing the solid angle available for accretion flows.
- Classifying inflow by particle history, we find that gas on first-infall onto a halo is metal-depleted by $\approx 2$~dex compared to pre-processed gas, which we find to mimic the circum-galactic medium (CGM) in terms of metal content.
- We also show that high (low) halo-scale gas accretion rates are associated with metal-poor (rich) CGM in haloes below $10^{12}M_{\odot}$, and that variation in halo-scale gas accretion rates may offer a physical explanation for the enhanced scatter in the star-forming main sequence at low ($\lesssim10^{9}M_{\odot}$) and high ($\gtrsim10^{10}M_{\odot}$) stellar masses.
- Our results highlight how gas inflow influences several halo- and galaxy-scale properties, and the need to combine kinematic and chemical data in order to confidently break the degeneracy between accreting and outgoing gas in CGM observations.
