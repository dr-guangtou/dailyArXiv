##### [An Extended Halo-based Group/Cluster finder: application to the DESI legacy imaging surveys DR8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14998)
- #cluster_galaxies #cluster_cosmology [[Galaxy Cluster Finders]]
- 主要特点是同时利用光谱和测光红移
- 构建了mock survey：For galaxies with magnitude z≤21 and redshift 0<z≤1.0 in the DESI legacy imaging surveys (The Legacy Surveys), our group finder successfully identifies more than 60% of the members in about 90% of halos with mass $>10^{12.5} M_{\odot}$.
- Groups with more than 10 members have a redshift accuracy of ∼0.008. We apply this group finder to the Legacy Surveys DR8 and find 6.4 Million groups with at least 3 members. About 500,000 of these groups have at least 10 members.

##### [A hybrid Fourier--Real Gaussian Mixture method for fast galaxy--PSF convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15797)
- #photometry [[References of Photometric Methods]]
- Fast convolution of a model galaxy profile by a point-spread function (PSF) model represented as a pixel grid.
- 方法基于如下三点：
	- 1. ost simple radial galaxy profiles of common interest (deVaucouleurs, exponential, Sersic) can be approximated as mixtures of Gaussians.
	- 2. The Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a Gaussian, thus the Fourier transform of a mixture-of-Gausssian approximation of a galaxy can be directly evaluated as a mixture of Gaussians in Fourier space.
	- 3. If a mixture component would result in Fourier-space aliasing, that component can be evaluated in real space.
- The method is fast and exact (to the extent that the mixture-of-Gaussians approximation of the galaxy profile is exact) as long as the pixelized PSF model is well sampled
- This Fourier method can be seen as a way of applying a perfect low-pass filter to the (typically strongly undersampled) galaxy profile before convolution by the PSF, at exactly the Nyquist frequency of the PSF pixel model grid.
- 展示代码在: https://github.com/dstndstn/fft-gal-convolution
- 方法已经在Tractor中使用；A lot of the computational cost of this method is in evaluating the exp function rather than in the FFT or inverseFFT, so [fast exp approximations](https://github.com/herumi/fmath) could provide significant speedups

##### [Principled point-source detection in collections of astronomical images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15836)
- #photometry 
- We review the well-known matched filter method for the detection of point sources in astronomical images. This is shown to be optimal (that is, to saturate the Cramer--Rao bound) under stated conditions that are very strong: an isolated source in background-dominated imaging with perfectly known background level, point-spread function, and noise models.
- We show that the matched filter produces a maximum-likelihood estimate of the brightness of a purported point source, and this leads to a simple way to combine multiple images---taken through the same bandpass filter but with different noise levels and point-spread functions---to produce an optimal point source detection map.
- 给出了基于SED的matched filter方法，能优先探测到特定颜色的点源

##### [Stability of Cool Cores During Galaxy Cluster Growth: A Joint Chandra/SPT Analysis of 67 Galaxy Clusters Along a Common Evolutionary Track Spanning 9 Gyr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14669)
- #intra_cluster_medium #cluster_galaxies [[Intra-Cluster Medium - 2021]]
- We develop a new procedure in order to tackle the analysis challenge that is estimating the intracluster medium (ICM) properties of low-mass and high-redshift clusters with ∼150 X-ray counts.
- We show that we can decrease the uncertainty on the density profile by a factor ∼5 with a joint deprojection of the X-ray surface brightness profile measured by Chandra and the SZ integrated Compton parameter available in the SPT cluster catalog.
- We confirm that the evolution of the gas density profile is well modeled by the combination of a fixed core and a self-similarly evolving non-cool core profile

##### [The Fast Radio Burst Dispersion Measure Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15051)
- #fast_radio_burst 
- We compare the dispersion measure (DM) statistics of FRBs detected by the ASKAP and Parkes radio telescopes. We jointly model their DM distributions, exploiting the fact that the telescopes have different survey fluence limits but likely sample the same underlying population.
- Assuming a one-to-one mapping between DM and redshift for an homogeneous intergalactic medium (IGM), we determine the best-fit parameters of the population spectral index and the power-law index of the burst energy distribution for different redshift evolutionary models.
- We find no evidence that the FRB population evolves faster than linearly with respect to the star formation rate over the DM (redshift) range for the sampled population.

##### [Jet collimation in NGC 315 and other nearby AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14831)
- These results suggest that disk winds play an important role in the jet collimation mechanism, particularly in high-luminosity sources. The impact of winds for the origin of the FRI/FRII dichotomy in radio galaxies is also discussed.

##### [Properties of a Previously Unidentified Instrumental Signature in Kepler/K2 that was Confused for AGN Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14452)
- Weakly illuminated pixels are dominated by low frequency trends that are both non-astrophysical and correlated from object to object.
- A critical clue to understanding this instrumental noise is that different targets observed in the same channels of Campaign 8 (rear facing) and Campaign 16 (forward facing) had nearly identical light curves after time reversal of one of the campaigns
	- The underlying problem relates to the relative Sun-spacecraft-field orientation, which was approximately the same on day 1 of Campaign 8 as the last day of Campaign 16.

##### [Satellites and central galaxies in SDSS: the influence of interactions on their properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14782)
- We find that central galaxies showing signs of interactions present evidence of enhanced star formation activity and younger stellar populations. As a counterpart, satellite samples show these galaxies presenting older stellar populations with a lower star formation rate than the control sample

- Shock destruction is relatively efficient, a single supernova clearing dust on average in at least ~1200 Msun/SN of gas
- We show that early-type galaxies are outliers in several scaling relations. This feature could result from grain thermal sputtering in hot X-ray emitting gas

##### [Estimation of the size and structure of the broad line region using Bayesian approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00802)

- We performed systematic modeling of the continuum and emission line light curves using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Bayesian statistics implemented in PBMAP (Parallel Bayesian code for reverberation-MAPping data) code to constrain BLR geometrical parameters and recover velocity integrated transfer function.
- We found a non-linear response of emission line fluxes to the ionizing optical continuum for 93\% objects. The estimated virial factors for the AGN studied in this work range from 0.79 to 4.94 having a mean at 1.78 (+/-) 1.77 consistent with the values found in the literature.

##### [Ultra-faint \[CII\] emission in a redshift-2 gravitationally-lensed metal-poor dwarf galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00841)

- ALMA \[CII\] and PdBI CO(2-1) observations of a z=1.8, strongly lensed EELG SL2S 0217, a bright Lyman-α emitter with a metallicity 0.05 Z⊙. We obtain a tentative (3-4σ) detection of the \[CII\] line and set an upper limit on the \[CII\]/SFR ratio 
- The CO(2-1) emission is not detected. Photoionization modelling indicates that up to 80% of the \[CII\] emission originates from neutral or molecular gas, although we can not rule out that the gas is fully ionized.
- The very faint \[CII\] emission is in line with both nearby metal-poor dwarfs and high-redshift Lyman-α emitters, and predictions from hydrodynamical simulations.

##### [Stacked phase-space density of galaxies around massive clusters: A theoretical framework and application to real data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01342)

- #cosmology/cluster #ssst/cos [[Cluster Phase Space]]
- 理论模型预测 predict average histograms of line-of-sight velocities over pairs of galaxies and galaxy clusters. 
- A simple likelihood analysis with our model enables us to infer the three-dimensional velocity dispersion of observed galaxies in massive clusters.
- Our results confirm that the relation between the galaxy velocity dispersion and the host cluster mass in our sample is consistent with the prediction in dark-matter-only N-body simulations.
- 重要背景：The stacked velocity distribution of galaxies around clusters, referred to as the stacked phase-space density, has drawn much attention as a probe of the average dynamical mass estimate and galactic orbits in the cluster regime (Wojtak et al. 2009), the physics of star formation quenching (Haines et al. 2015; Adhikari et al. 2019), and large-scale galaxy infall (Aung et al. 2020; Tomooka et al. 2020).

- 18个XMM Cluster Survey里的星系团：We apply a rest-frame μB\=25 mag/arcsec2 isophotal threshold to our clusters, below which we define light as the ICL
- We find that the ICL makes up about ∼ 24% of the total cluster stellar mass on average (∼ 41% including the flux contained in the BCG within 50 kpc)
- We find no evidence for any links between the amount of ICL flux with cluster mass, but find a growth rate of 2−4 for the ICL between 0.1<z<0.5.

- The modified Newtonian dynamics is also inconsistent with a shallow radial acceleration relationship of AGC 242019
- As a UDG, AGC 242019 is in a dwarf-size halo with weak stellar feedback, late formation time, a normal baryonic spin and low star formation efficiency (SFR/gas).

- #cmb
- We find that the SPT-3G dataset is well-fit by a ΛCDM cosmological model with parameter constraints consistent with those from Planck and SPTpol data. From SPT-3G data alone, we find H0\=68.8±1.5kms−1Mpc−1 and σ8\=0.789±0.016, with a gravitational lensing amplitude consistent with the ΛCDM prediction (AL\=0.98±0.12).

- #cosmology/reionization
- In Mao et al. 2019 (Paper I) we presented an improved, local density-dependent model for the sub-grid gas clumping. Here we extend this using an _empirical stochastic model_ based on the results from high-resolution numerical simulations which fully resolve all relevant fluctuations.

##### [Laboratory Measurements of Instrumental Signatures of the LSST Camera Focal Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01281)

- #lsst
- Testing of the camera sensors is performed using a set of custom-built optical projectors, designed to illuminate the full focal plane or specific regions of the focal plane with a series of light illumination patterns: the crosstalk projector, the flat illuminator projector, and the spot grid projector.
- In addition to measurements of crosstalk, linearity and full well, the ability to project realistically-sized sources, using the spot grid projector, makes possible unique measurements of instrumental signatures such as deferred charge distortions, astrometric shifts due to sensor effects, and the brighter-fatter effect, prior to camera first light.

- X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in AGN allow us to probe and understand the nature of accretion in highly curved space-time
- We report QPO candidates in 6 AGN (7 including one tentative detection in MRK~766) from our sample of 38, which tend to be found at characteristic energies and, in four cases, at the same frequency across at least two observations, indicating they are highly unlikely to be spurious in nature.

##### [Regulating Star Formation in Nearby Dusty Galaxies: Low Photoelectric Efficiencies in the Most Compact Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01182)

- We find that star-forming, IR luminous galaxies in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) with high IR surface densities have low photoelectric efficiencies. These systems also have, on average, higher ratios of radiation field strength to gas densities, and larger average dust grain size distributions.
- The most compact galaxies have more young star-forming regions per unit area, which exhibit less efficient gas heating
- Diaz-Santos et al. (2017):  $\log \left(\mathrm{L}_{\text {line }} / \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{IR}}\right)=a_{0}+a_{1} \log \Sigma_{\mathrm{IR}}+a_{2}\left(\log \Sigma_{\mathrm{IR}}\right)^{2}$

- 一个核心射电辐射弱，但有大尺度射电双瓣的高红移射电星系
- Based on long-slit spectroscopy and narrow band imaging centered on the Lyα emission, we identify two spatial components: a "compact component" with high velocity dispersion (∼1500kms−1) seen in all three lines, and an "extended component", having low velocity dispersion (i.e., 700-1000kms−1)
- We also detect spatially extended associated Lyα absorption, which is blue-shifted within 250-400kms−1 of the Lyα peak. The probability of Lyα absorption detection in such large radio sources is found to be low (∼10%)

##### [The rapid transition from star-formation to AGN dominated rest-frame UV light at z ~ 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01195)

- We find a rapid transition to AGN-dominated sources bright-ward of MUV≃−23.2.
	- The effect is observed in the rest-frame UV morphology and size-luminosity relation, where extended clumpy systems become point-source dominated, and also in the available spectra for the sample.

##### [Dating individual quasars with the HeII proximity effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01196)

- #smbh
- Due to the ~30 Myr equilibration time-scale of HeII in the z~3 IGM, the size of the HeII proximity zone depends on the time the quasar had been active before our observation
- 13个QSO的HST观测：spanning ~2 to ~15 proper Mpc.
- Comparing these sizes to predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with one-dimensional radiative transfer, we infer a broad range of quasar on-times from t\_on<1 Myr to t\_on>30 Myr that does not depend on quasar luminosity, black hole mass, or Eddington ratio.

##### [Mass accretion rates and multi-scale halo environment in cold and warm dark matter cosmologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01198)

- #halo/assemby_bias
- As expected from excursion set models, WDM haloes have higher specific accretion rates, dominated by the accretion of diffuse mass, as compared to CDM haloes.
- For low-mass WDM haloes, we find that the environment-dependence of both diffuse mass accretion as well as accretion by mergers is almost fully explained by α, the tidal anisotropy
- We detect, for the first time, a significant and evolving assembly bias due to diffuse mass accretion for low-mass CDM and WDM haloes (after excluding splashback objects), with a z\=0 strength higher than with almost all known secondary variables and largely explained by α. [[Assembly Bias]]

- ALMA观测已知最远的red quasar
- The FIR continuum of J1205−0000 is bright; The \[C II\] line emission is extended on scales of r∼5 kpc, greater than the FIR continuum.
- The outflow kinetic energy and momentum are both much smaller than what predicted in energy-conserving wind models, suggesting that the AGN feedback in this quasar is not capable of completely suppressing its star formation.

##### [The Evolution of the Lyman-Alpha Luminosity Function During Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01205)

- 原理：Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuates Lyα photons emitted by galaxies. As reionization progressed the IGM opacity decreased, increasing Lyα visibility. The galaxy Lyα luminosity function (LF) is thus a useful tool to constrain the timeline of reionization.
- 给 $5 < z < 10$的Lya LF建模：As the neutral fraction increases, the average number density of Lyα emitting galaxies decreases, and are less luminous, though for $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} < 0.4$ there is only a small decrease of the Lyα LF.

- Exposure times of ~5 ks are required to detect the majority of host galaxies in the NIRCam wide-band filters, however even 10 ks exposures with MIRI result in <30% successful host detections.

##### [The MOSDEF Survey: Environmental dependence of the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies at 1.4≤z≤2.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01706)

- Based on rest-frame optical emission lines, \[NII\]λ6584 and Hα, we measure gas-phase oxygen abundance of 167 galaxies at 1.37≤z≤1.7 and 303 galaxies at 2.09≤z≤2.61, located in diverse environments.
- We find that at z∼1.5, the average metallicity of galaxies in overdensities is higher than in the field 但这种金属丰度的增高在z=2.3不存在
- Our results support the hypothesis that, at the early stages of cluster formation, owing to efficient gas cooling, galaxies residing in overdensities host a higher fraction of pristine gas with prominent primordial gas accretion, which lowers their gas-phase metallicity compared to their coeval field galaxies.

##### [Structure formation in large-volume cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter: Impact of the non-linear dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01828)

- An ultra-light bosonic particle of mass in the range ≈10^{−22} eV/c2 is of special interest, as it both has particle physics motivations, and may give rise to notable differences in the structures on highly non-linear scales due to the manifestation of quantum-physical wave effects on macroscopic scales.
- Unlike in ΛCDM, it is computationally challenging to accurately treat the growth on large scales in FDM, even in the regime where this follows linear theory.
- FDM shows a pronounced suppression of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which can be understood as a damping effect due to 'quantum pressure'.
- The halo mass functions are identical for massive haloes, but FDM shows a significant abundance reduction below a characteristic mass scale.

- We present results based on the spatial offsets between the emission-line regions and stellar continua in ELGs from two z∼0.25 galaxy clusters, Abell 2390 and Abell 2465
- Combining the two clusters, there is a 3σ excess for high-velocity galaxies within the virial radius having the offsets to be pointed away from the cluster center. 
- Assuming the offset being a proxy for the velocity vector of a galaxy, as expected from ram pressure stripping, this excess indicates that ram pressure stripping occurs most effectively during the first passage of an infalling galaxy

- All 12 galaxies are found to be reasonably well described by two-dimensional Sersic functions, although UGC 4879 in particular shows tentative evidence of two distinct components. 
- No prominent extended stellar substructures, that could be signs of either faint satellites or recent mergers, are identified in the outer regions of any of the systems examined. 

##### [Wolf-Rayet galaxies in SDSS-IV MaNGA. II. Metallicity dependence of the high-mass slope of the stellar initial mass function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03217)

- We measure the equivalent width of the WR blue bump at ~4650 AA from each spectrum, and make comparisons with predictions of both singular population models in Starburst99 and binary population models in BPASS.
- These analyses have consistently led to a positive correlation of IMF high-mass slope α with stellar metallicity Z, i.e. with steeper IMF (more bottom-heavy) at higher metallicities

- We find a clear progression from field, to filament, and cluster galaxies for decreasing SFR, increasing fraction of galaxies in the quenching phase, increasing proportion of early-type galaxies and decreasing gas content.
- As the environmental density increases, the gas depletion time decreases, since the gas content decreases faster than the SFR. 气体的剥离比SF的quenching快得多

- We find a mass trend $\lambda \propto M^{B}$ consistent with a linear relation (B∼1), no significant redshift evolution and an intrinsic scatter in richness of σλ\=0.22±0.06.
- At low richness SPT-SZ confirms fewer redMaPPer clusters than expected. We interpret this richness dependent deficit in confirmed systems as due to the increased presence at low richness of low mass objects not correctly accounted for by our richness-mass scatter model, which we call contaminants.
- 在$\lambda = 40$, contamination比例在12%左右；在$\lambda = 20$，比例占22%
- The mean mass from stacked weak lensing (WL) measurements suggests that these low mass contaminants are galaxy groups with masses $\sim 3-5 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$

- The median value of this ratio for all the sampled regions is larger than the expected momentum just from supernovae explosions.
- Our results also suggest that Ph can be considered as the main parameter that modulates star formation at kpc scales, rather than individual components of the baryonic mass.

- When ionization corrections are included, subDLAs are systematically more metal-poor than DLAs
- The correlation of gas-phase \[Si/Fe\] with metallicity in subDLAs appears to be consistent with that of DLAs, suggesting that the two classes of absorbers have a similar relative dust depletion pattern.

- We aim to test how well Jeans-Anisotropic-MGE (JAM) models using GCs (positions and line-of-sight velocities) as tracers can constrain the mass and radial distribution of DM halos. 
- 基于E-MOSAICS模拟：We find that the DM halo properties are reasonably well recovered by the JAM models. There is, however, a strong correlation between how well we recover the mass and the radial distribution of the DM and the number of GCs
	- At least 150 GCs are needed in order to guarantee that the JAM model will perform well.

- The CO emission lines are clearly detected and the CO(5-4)/CO(2-1) flux ratio (R\_52) is ~1, similar to that of the Milky Way.
- We find that R\_52 peak coincides with the position of the UV clump and its value is approximately two times higher than the galactic average. 说明UV clump中气体温度或者密度较高

##### [APOGEE DR16: a multi-zone chemical evolution model for the Galactic disc based on MCMC methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08803)

- An inside-out formation of the Galaxy disc naturally emerges from the best fit of our two-infall chemical-evolution model to APOGEE-DR16: inner Galactic regions are assembled on shorter time-scales compared to the external ones.
- In the outer disc (with radii R\>6 kpc), the chemical dilution due to a late accretion event of gas with primordial chemical composition is the main driver of the \[Mg/Fe\] vs. \[Fe/H\] abundance pattern in the low-α sequence.
- Our results propose a clear interpretation of the \[Mg/Fe\] vs. \[Fe/H\] relations along the Galactic discs. The signatures of a delayed gas-rich merger which gives rise to a hiatus in the star formation history of the Galaxy are impressed in the \[Mg/Fe\] vs. \[Fe/H\] relation, determining how the low-α stars are distributed in the abundance space at different Galactocentric distances.

- #ssst_sci #cosmology/rsd 
- We take a different perspective to split the galaxy density field according to the local density, and cross-correlate those densities with the entire galaxy field. 比直接用2PCF要好
	- 1. The distribution of peculiar velocities in each split density is nearly Gaussian.
	- 2. The PDF of the density field at small scales is non-Gaussian, but the CCFs of split densities capture the non-Gaussianity, leading to improved cosmological constraints over the 2PCF.
	- 3. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are contained in all CCFs of split densities. Including BAO scales helps to break the degeneracy between the line-of-sight and transverse AP parameters, allowing independent constraints on them.

- LAGER-z7OD1 shows an elongated shape and consists of two subprotoclusters, which would have merged into one massive cluster
- The total volume of the ionized bubbles generated by its member galaxies is found to be comparable to the volume of the protocluster itself, indicating that we are witnessing the merging of the individual bubbles and that the intergalactic medium within the protocluster is almost fully ionized.

	- 主要的驱动参数是H的柱密度；Within the parameter space probed by METAL, no correlation with molecular fraction or radiation field intensity are found.
- Dust-to-metal; Dust-to-gas比例随气体柱密度改变，从diffuse区域到molecular gas区域升高3-4倍
	- 这个相关 have important implications for the sub-grid physics of chemical evolution, gas and dust mass estimates throughout cosmic times
- Interstellar depletions are the logarithm of the fraction of metals in the gas-phase. Thus, the depletion for element X is $\delta(X)=\log _{10}(X / H)_{\text {gas }}-\log _{10}(X / H)_{\text {total }}$
	- $\log _{10}(X / H)_{\text {total }}$ is the total abundance of X (gas + dust)., assumed to be equal to the abundance of X in the photospheres of young stars that have formed out of the ISM recently

	- Measurement of this signal will be very challenging not only because the overall strength is weaker than the sensitivity of SKA, but also because Faraday rotation due to Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields significantly modifies the observed polarization.

##### [Explaining the scatter in the galaxy mass-metallicity relation with gas flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11021)

- The correlations between the residuals of the MZR and the residuals of the other relations with mass are interrelated, but we find that gas fraction, specific inflow rate and specific outflow rate all have at least some independent influence on the scatter of the MZR.
- The timescales involved in the residual correlations and the time that galaxies stay above the MZR are revealed to be a few Gyr. However, most galaxies that are below the MZR at z\=0 have been below the MZR throughout their lifetimes.

##### [SDSS-IV MaNGA: the "G-dwarf problem" revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11022)

- Most famously, the "G-dwarf problem" highlighted the small number of low-metallicity G-dwarf stars in the Milky Way, which is inconsistent with the simplest picture of a galaxy formed from a "closed box" of gas
- Our analysis shows that high-mass spirals generically show a similar deficit of low-metallicity stars, implying that the Milky Way's history of gas accretion is common

##### [Black Hole and Galaxy Coevolution in Moderately Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei at z~1.4 in SXDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11273)

- We investigate the relation of black hole mass versus host stellar mass and that of mass accretion rate versus star formation rate (SFR) in moderately luminous X-ray selected broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z\=1.18−1.68
- Most of their hosts are confirmed to be main sequence star forming galaxies. We find that the mean ratio of the black hole mass (MBH) to the total stellar mass (Mstellar) is logMBH/Mstellar\=−2.2, which is similar to the local black hole-to-bulge mass ratio.
- This suggests that if the host galaxies of these moderately luminous AGNs at z∼1.4 are dominated by bulges, they already established the local black hole mass-bulge mass relation

	- When imposing flat priors on GN, we obtain a wide distribution of GN
	- However, imposing an empirically motivated log-normal prior returns a virtually constant GN with no sacrifice in fit quality.

- The simulations are among the first to employ on-the-fly radiation transfer and constrained transport ideal MHD in a cosmological context to simultaneously model the inhomogeneous process of reionization and the growth of primordial magnetic fields
- Detecting changes in the Lyα forest due to PMFs will be challenging because photoionisation and photoheating efficiently smooth the density field.

- This study shows that by analyzing the absorption features inside quasar proximity zones we can potentially constrain quasar properties and the environments they reside in.

	- Find a correlation between the excess emission and obscuration, suggesting a connection between the nuclear obscuring material and the galactic molecular clouds.

- 关于爱星系统计性质，有很大的个体差异：we find a remarkable level of diversity and host-to-host scatter across individual host galaxies.
- The number of all satellites (subhaloes) ever accreted is larger by a factor of 4-5 (3-5) than those surviving to z = 0
	- Hosts with larger galaxy stellar mass, brighter K-band luminosity, larger total halo mass, and more recent halo assembly typically have a larger number of surviving satellites.
- There is no missing satellites problem with TNG50.

- #galaxy/assembly #galaxy/etg #galaxy/model #galaxy/simulation
- Magneticum模拟中：和其他模拟比，小质量星系的accreted质量比例更高
- Based on the radial distribution of the accreted and in-situ components, we define 6 galaxy classes, from completely accretion dominated to completely in-situ dominated
	- About 70% of our galaxies have one transition radius. However, we also find about 10% of the galaxies to be accretion dominated everywhere, and about 13% to have two transition radii, with the centre and the outskirts both being accretion dominated. 有些星系是在中心和外围被ex-situ components dominated.
- Finally, we show that the dips in observed surface brightness profiles seen in many early-type galaxies do not correspond to the transition from in-situ to accretion-dominated regions, and any inferred mass fractions are not indicative of the true accreted mass.

	- We recognize three fundamental regimes: an early phase of evolution (z≳2), and internal and external (mainly mergers) processes that act at later times.

- #cosmology #cosmology/rsd [[Redshift Space Distortion]]
- We use a simulation-based modelling approach to analyse the anisotropic clustering of the BOSS LOWZ sample
- Our full-scale analysis yields constraints on the growth of structure that are a factor of two more stringent than any other study on large scales at similar redshifts.
- Our results are thus consistent with Planck, but also follow the trend seen in previous low-redshift measurements of fσ8 falling slightly below the ΛCDM+CMB prediction.
- We find that small and large radial scales yield mutually consistent values of fσ8, but there are 1−2.5σ hints of small scales (<10h−1Mpc) preferring lower values for fσ8 relative to larger scales.

- 基于SKIRT预测星系中的延展尘埃分布
- The dust-continuum half-light radius at observed-frame 850 μm is up to ∼75 per cent larger than the stellar half-mass radius, but significantly more compact than the observed-frame 1.6 μm (roughly corresponding to H-band) half-light radius 
	- 尤其是对于比较高红移的星系
	- This is driven by obscuration of stellar light from the galaxy centres, which increases the apparent extent of 1.6 μm disk sizes relative to that at 850 μm
	- 所以说高红移星系中看到的中心高度聚集的尘埃发射未必是正在build-up dense stellar component的证据
- Single band dust-continuum emission is a good tracer of the location of (obscured) star formation.

##### [The cumulative star-formation histories of dwarf galaxies with TNG50. I: Environment-driven diversity and connection to quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12226)

- #galaxy/dwarf #galaxy/simulation #galaxy/quenching #galaxy/environment
- The key factors determining the dwarfs' SFHs are their status as central or satellite and their stellar mass, with centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later times on average compared to satellites and lower mass dwarfs.
- TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs for both centrals and satellites, so that the stacked cumulative SFHs are representative of the TNG50 dwarf populations only in an average sense
- Satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass, found closer to the cluster centre, or accreted at earlier times, show significantly earlier stellar mass assembly.
- We also find a subtle effect whereby satellite dwarfs in the most massive hosts at z=0 have higher SFRs at early times, well before final infall into their z=0 host, compared to a control sample of centrals mass-matched at the time of accretion.

	- We confirm the presence of an active BH via the AGN coronal line \[Fe X\] and enhanced \[O I\] emission coincident with the radio source.

- In TNG50, SFGs also form a j−M⋆−(V/σ) plane but correlates more with galaxy size than with morphological parameters.

- 有LOFAR探测的和没有射电探测的在CIV发射线蓝移和等值宽度分布上没有差别。
	- The loudest, most luminous and largest radio sources exist preferentially at low CIV blueshifts

- This release contains HI measurements from 2135 Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations and an updated crossmatch of the SDSS-IV MaNGA sample with the ALFALFA survey
- M\_HI/M\_\* is very weakly correlated with the equivalent width of Halpha, implying a loose connection between the instantaneous star formation rate and the HI reservoir
- Galaxies with elevated HI depletion times have enhanced \[OI\]/Halpha and depressed Halpha surface brightness, consistent with more HI residing in a diffuse and/or shock heated phase which is less capable of condensing into molecular clouds.
- We recover the strong anti-correlation between M\_HI/M\_\* and gas-phase metallicity seen in previous studies.
