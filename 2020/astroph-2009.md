- [A consistent and robust measurement of the thermal state of the IGM at 2≤z≤4 from a large sample of Lyα forest spectra: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00016)
    - thermal IGM evolution code CITE 处理模拟，生成mock光谱校准方法
    - The thermal parameters inferred from our measurements of the flux power spectrum, Doppler parameter distribution, as well as wavelet and curvature statistics agree well within their respective errors and all clearly show the peak in temperature and minimum in slope of the temperature density relation expected from HeII reionization.
    - The peak in the temperature evolution occurs at z≈3, in agreement with previous measurements that had suggested the presence of such a peak, albeit with a large scatter.

- [Harnessing the Population Statistics of Subhalos to Search for Annihilating Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00021)
    - 探测银河系中没有恒星成分的小halo的方法：search for individual unassociated gamma-ray sources with properties consistent with the dark matter expectation 但排除其他天体物理起源很难
    - we present a complementary approach that harnesses information about the entire population of subhalos-such as their spatial and mass distribution in the Galaxy-to search for a signal of annihilating dark matter
    - We show that the collective emission from subhalos can imprint itself in a unique way on the statistics of observed photons, even when individual subhalos may be too dim to be resolved on their own.

- [KiDS+VIKING-450: Consistency tests for cosmic shear tomography with a colour-based split of source galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00367)
    - On the modelling side, we examine the observational nuisance parameters, specifically those for the redshift calibration and intrinsic alignments, using a Bayesian analysis with dedicated test parameters. We verify that the current nuisance parameters are sufficient for the KV450 data to capture residual systematics

- [Forward modeling the multiwavelength properties of Active Galactic Nuclei: application to X-ray and WISE mid-infrared samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - 研究不同电磁波段挑选的AGN有何不同的模型：The core of the model are observationally derived probabilites on the occupation of galaxies by X-ray selected AGN. These are used to seed mock galaxies drawn from stellar-mass functions with accretion events and then associate them with spectral energy distributions that describe both the stellar and AGN emission components.
    - WISE挑选的AGN里主要的污染来自z<0.5的恒星形成星系
    - 模型没有很好的重现X-ray weak的AGN

- [Beyond halo mass: the role of vorticity-rich filaments in quenching galaxy mass assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00013)
    - **Relevant**
    - Horizon-AGN+DISPERSE看halo assembly堆在cosmic web中位置的依赖: we detect a direct and non-negligible influence of cosmic filaments.
    - 接近filament一般意味着恒星质量聚集的enhance；但在filaments的边缘也看到了SF被抑制的迹象 (filament边缘整体角动量高，气体从halo外向中心输送的效率被降低)
    - We find clues for compaction of the stellar distribution at close proximity to filaments. 

- [Observing the stellar halo of Andromeda in cosmological simulations: the Auriga2PAndAS pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - **CSST**
    - 通过细致的mock observation比较Auriga模拟和M31恒星晕的PAndAS观测
    - We show that the simulations are overall compatible with the observations. Nevertheless, some systematic differences exist, such as a preponderance for metal-rich stars in the mocks. While these differences could suggest that M31 had a different accretion history or has a different mass compared to the simulated systems, it is more likely a consequence of an under-quenching of the star formation history of galaxies, related to the resolution of the Auriga simulations.

- [RELICS: A Candidate z~6.8 Strong [OIII] emitter and Other Properties of z>5.5 Galaxies Inferred from Spitzer and Hubble Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00020)
    - 184个6 < z < 8星系候选：恒星质量在10^6-8 Msun之间；While our sample is mostly comprised of LUV/L∗UV<1 galaxies, there are a number of brighter objects in the sample, extending to LUV/L∗UV∼2
    - Among these is PLCKG287+32-2013, one of the brightest z∼7 candidates known (AB mag 24.9) with a Spitzer 3.6μm flux excess suggesting strong [OIII] + H-β emission

- [The web of the Giant: spectroscopic confirmation of a Large Scale Structure around the z=6.31 quasar SDSS~J1030+0524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00024)
    - The structure is populated by at least six members, four Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and two Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs). 分布在视线方向上5 pMpc范围内
    - The spectral properties of the six member galaxies (Lyalpha strength and UV luminosity) are similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts.
    - Our finding lends support to the idea that the most distant and massive black holes form and grow within massive (>10^{12} Msun) dark matter halos in large scale structures

- [Power Spectrum of Intrinsic Alignments of Galaxies in IllustrisTNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00276)
    - **SSST**
    - 3-D intrinsic alignment power spectra between galaxy shape/spin and tidal field across 0.1< k/hMpc−1<60 using cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Illustris-TNG300, at redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 2.
    - The shape-tidal field alignment increases with galaxy mass and the linear alignment coefficient AIA, defined with respect to the primordial tidal field, is found to have weak redshift dependence.
    - We also show a promising detection of the shape/spin-tidal field alignments for stellar mass limited samples and a weak or almost null signal for star-forming galaxies for the TNG300 volume
    - The shape of massive disk- and spheroid-galaxies tend to align with the tidal field. The spin of the low-mass spheroids tend to be parallel with the filament, while the spin of disks and massive spheroids tend to be perpendicular to the filament.

- [Elemental Abundances in M31: Properties of the Inner Stellar Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00529)
    - We have increased the sample size of [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] measurements from 101 to a total of 229 individual M31 RGB stars.
    - Inner halo: ⟨[Fe/H]⟩ = −1.08 ± 0.04 and ⟨[α/Fe]⟩ = 0.40 ± 0.03
    - Between 8--34 kpc, the inner halo has a steep [Fe/H] gradient (−0.025 ± 0.002 dex kpc−1) and negligible [α/Fe] gradient, where substructure in the inner halo is systematically more metal-rich than the smooth component of the halo at a given projected distance.
