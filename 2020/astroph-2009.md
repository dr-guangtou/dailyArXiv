- [A consistent and robust measurement of the thermal state of the IGM at 2≤z≤4 from a large sample of Lyα forest spectra: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00016)
    - thermal IGM evolution code CITE 处理模拟，生成mock光谱校准方法
    - The thermal parameters inferred from our measurements of the flux power spectrum, Doppler parameter distribution, as well as wavelet and curvature statistics agree well within their respective errors and all clearly show the peak in temperature and minimum in slope of the temperature density relation expected from HeII reionization.
    - The peak in the temperature evolution occurs at z≈3, in agreement with previous measurements that had suggested the presence of such a peak, albeit with a large scatter.

- [Harnessing the Population Statistics of Subhalos to Search for Annihilating Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00021)
    - 探测银河系中没有恒星成分的小halo的方法：search for individual unassociated gamma-ray sources with properties consistent with the dark matter expectation 但排除其他天体物理起源很难
    - we present a complementary approach that harnesses information about the entire population of subhalos-such as their spatial and mass distribution in the Galaxy-to search for a signal of annihilating dark matter
    - We show that the collective emission from subhalos can imprint itself in a unique way on the statistics of observed photons, even when individual subhalos may be too dim to be resolved on their own.

- [KiDS+VIKING-450: Consistency tests for cosmic shear tomography with a colour-based split of source galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00367)
    - On the modelling side, we examine the observational nuisance parameters, specifically those for the redshift calibration and intrinsic alignments, using a Bayesian analysis with dedicated test parameters. We verify that the current nuisance parameters are sufficient for the KV450 data to capture residual systematics

- [Forward modeling the multiwavelength properties of Active Galactic Nuclei: application to X-ray and WISE mid-infrared samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - 研究不同电磁波段挑选的AGN有何不同的模型：The core of the model are observationally derived probabilites on the occupation of galaxies by X-ray selected AGN. These are used to seed mock galaxies drawn from stellar-mass functions with accretion events and then associate them with spectral energy distributions that describe both the stellar and AGN emission components.
    - WISE挑选的AGN里主要的污染来自z<0.5的恒星形成星系
    - 模型没有很好的重现X-ray weak的AGN

- [Beyond halo mass: the role of vorticity-rich filaments in quenching galaxy mass assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00013)
    - **Relevant**
    - Horizon-AGN+DISPERSE看halo assembly堆在cosmic web中位置的依赖: we detect a direct and non-negligible influence of cosmic filaments.
    - 接近filament一般意味着恒星质量聚集的enhance；但在filaments的边缘也看到了SF被抑制的迹象 (filament边缘整体角动量高，气体从halo外向中心输送的效率被降低)
    - We find clues for compaction of the stellar distribution at close proximity to filaments.

- [Observing the stellar halo of Andromeda in cosmological simulations: the Auriga2PAndAS pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - **CSST**
    - 通过细致的mock observation比较Auriga模拟和M31恒星晕的PAndAS观测
    - We show that the simulations are overall compatible with the observations. Nevertheless, some systematic differences exist, such as a preponderance for metal-rich stars in the mocks. While these differences could suggest that M31 had a different accretion history or has a different mass compared to the simulated systems, it is more likely a consequence of an under-quenching of the star formation history of galaxies, related to the resolution of the Auriga simulations.

- [RELICS: A Candidate z~6.8 Strong [OIII] emitter and Other Properties of z>5.5 Galaxies Inferred from Spitzer and Hubble Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00020)
    - 184个6 < z < 8星系候选：恒星质量在10^6-8 Msun之间；While our sample is mostly comprised of LUV/L∗UV<1 galaxies, there are a number of brighter objects in the sample, extending to LUV/L∗UV∼2
    - Among these is PLCKG287+32-2013, one of the brightest z∼7 candidates known (AB mag 24.9) with a Spitzer 3.6μm flux excess suggesting strong [OIII] + H-β emission

- [The web of the Giant: spectroscopic confirmation of a Large Scale Structure around the z=6.31 quasar SDSS~J1030+0524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00024)
    - The structure is populated by at least six members, four Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and two Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs). 分布在视线方向上5 pMpc范围内
    - The spectral properties of the six member galaxies (Lyalpha strength and UV luminosity) are similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts.
    - Our finding lends support to the idea that the most distant and massive black holes form and grow within massive (>10^{12} Msun) dark matter halos in large scale structures

- [Power Spectrum of Intrinsic Alignments of Galaxies in IllustrisTNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00276)
    - **SSST**
    - 3-D intrinsic alignment power spectra between galaxy shape/spin and tidal field across 0.1< k/hMpc−1<60 using cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Illustris-TNG300, at redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 2.
    - The shape-tidal field alignment increases with galaxy mass and the linear alignment coefficient AIA, defined with respect to the primordial tidal field, is found to have weak redshift dependence.
    - We also show a promising detection of the shape/spin-tidal field alignments for stellar mass limited samples and a weak or almost null signal for star-forming galaxies for the TNG300 volume
    - The shape of massive disk- and spheroid-galaxies tend to align with the tidal field. The spin of the low-mass spheroids tend to be parallel with the filament, while the spin of disks and massive spheroids tend to be perpendicular to the filament.

- [Elemental Abundances in M31: Properties of the Inner Stellar Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00529)
    - We have increased the sample size of [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] measurements from 101 to a total of 229 individual M31 RGB stars.
    - Inner halo: ⟨[Fe/H]⟩ = −1.08 ± 0.04 and ⟨[α/Fe]⟩ = 0.40 ± 0.03
    - Between 8--34 kpc, the inner halo has a steep [Fe/H] gradient (−0.025 ± 0.002 dex kpc−1) and negligible [α/Fe] gradient, where substructure in the inner halo is systematically more metal-rich than the smooth component of the halo at a given projected distance.

### Sep 2

- [Dark Matter Density Profiles in Dwarf Galaxies: Linking Jeans Modeling Systematics and Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00613)
    - We apply spherical Jeans modeling to simulated stellar kinematic data of spherical, isotropic dwarf galaxies with the goal of identifying the future observational directions
    - We use mock observation to demonstrate the difficulty in constraining the inner core/cusp of the dark matter distribution with datasets of fewer than 10,000 stars.

- [MOONS: The New Multi-Object Spectrograph for the VLT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00628)
    - The collecting power of an 8-m telescope, 1000 fibres with individual robotic positioners, and both low- and high-resolution simultaneous spectral coverage across the 0.64-1.8 micron wavelength range.

- [Stellar initial mass function variation in massive early-type galaxies: the potential role of the deuterium abundance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00616)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - We demonstrate that the abundance of deuterium in the birth clouds of forming stars may be important in setting the IMF.
    - We use models of disc accretion onto low-mass protostars to show that those forming from deuterium-poor gas are expected to have zero-age main sequence masses significantly lower than those forming from primordial (high deuterium fraction) material.
    - Using the EAGLE simulation we show that stellar mass loss-induced deuterium variations are strongest in the same regions where IMF variations are observed: at the centres of the most massive, metal-rich, passive galaxies

- [CLEAR: Paschen-β Star Formation Rates and Dust Attenuation of Low Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00617)
    - 32个HST G141 grism观测的近邻星系：Many of the galaxies in the sample have significantly higher Paβ emission than expected from the star formation rates (SFRs) measured from their (attenuation-corrected) UV continuum or Hα emission
    - 说明Paβ线解释了之前隐藏的SF；Galaxies with lower stellar mass tend to have more scatter in their ratio of Paβ to attenuation-corrected UV SFRs. 说明bursty SFH
    - These results show that Paβ is a valuable tracer of a galaxy's star formation rate, often revealing star formation that is otherwise missed by UV and optical tracers.

- [Yonsei Evolutionary Population Synthesis (YEPS) Model. III. Surface Brightness Fluctuation of Normal and Helium-enhanced Simple Stellar Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00625)
    - **Relevant**
    - Present an evolutionary population synthesis model of the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) for normal and He-enriched simple stellar populations (SSPs)
    - He-rich产生更热的水平支恒星和更亮的红团簇恒星
    - We show that the SBF magnitudes are affected by He-rich populations at least ∼0.3~mag even in I- and near-IR bands at given colors, from which the SBF-based distances are often derived
    - We propose that when combined with independent metallicity and age indicators such as Mg2 and Hβ, the UV and optical SBFs can readily detect underlying He-rich populations in unresolved stellar systems at a distance out to ≳20 Mpc

- [MOONS Surveys of the Milky Way and its Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00635)
    - MOONS will observe up to 1000 targets across a 25-arcminute field of view in the optical and near-infrared (0.6-1.8 micron) simultaneously. A high-resolution (R~19700) setting in the H band has been designed for the accurate determination of stellar abundances such as alpha, light, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements.

- [A Novel Machine Learning Approach to Disentangle Multi-Temperature Regions in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00625)
    - Synthetic spectra containing a various number of underlying thermal components were created using well-established tools available from the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
    - We also confirm that the core of the Perseus cluster contains a mix of differing underlying thermal components.

- [MOONRISE: The Main MOONS GTO Extragalactic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00644)
    - Most importantly, by spectroscopically identifying hundreds of thousands of galaxies at high redshift, the MOONS surveys will be capable of determining the environments in which primeval galaxies lived and will reveal how such environments affected galaxy evolution.

- [Models of Distorted and Evolving Dark Matter Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00645)
    - We investigate the ability of basis function expansions to reproduce the evolution of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo, extracted from a cosmological zoom-in simulation.
    - Despite the many possible biorthonormal expansions, it is hard to beat a conventional Hernquist-Ostriker expansion with a moderate number of terms (≳15 radial and ≳6 angular)

- [Tracing the total molecular gas in galaxies: [CII] and the CO-dark gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00649)
    - We explore a method to quantify the total H2 mass (MH2) in galaxies and learn what parameters control the CO-dark gas reservoir 用Cloudy模型看总H2质量和各种观测 [OI], [CI], CO(1-0), [CII], total infrared luminosity 的关系
    - While the H2 traced by CO(1-0) can be negligible, the [CII] 158 micron line can trace the total H2. 70% to 100% of the total H2 mass is not traced by CO(1-0) in the dwarf galaxies, but is well-traced by [CII] 158 micron line
    - A conversion factor for [CII] luminosity to total H2 and a new CO-to-total-MH2 conversion factor, as a function of metallicity, is presented.

- [A homogeneous measurement of the delay between the onsets of gas stripping and star formation quenching in satellite galaxies of groups and clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00667)
    - 结合模拟中的轨道信息和解析模型研究SDSS星系的quenching和ALFALFA星系中看到的gas stripping
    - Our models recover the typical time when galaxies in the satellite population are stripped and quenched: stripping in massive (Mvir ∼ 10^14.5 M) clusters typically occurs at or just before the first pericentric passage, and up to ∼ 4 Gyr later in low mass (∼ 1012.5 M) groups
    - Quenching发生得比气体剥离更晚更慢：Balmer emission lines typically fade ∼ 4 Gyr (6.5 Gyr) after first pericentre in clusters (groups), followed a few hundred Myr later by reddenning in (g − r) colour.
    - 基本就是Slow-then-rapid模型，但是quenching时标更长

- [Gas and Star Formation from HD and Dust Emission in a Strongly Lensed Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00674)
    - We extend an additional molecular gas tracer to high-redshift studies by observing hydrogen deuteride (HD) emission in the strongly lensed z=5.656 galaxy SPT0346-52 with ALMA
    - 只有上限限制：M_H2 < 6x10^11 Msun;
    - 观测 implies a CO conversion factor of αCO<2.2, which is between the standard values for MW-like galaxies and starbursts. These properties confirm that SPT0346-52 is a heavily starbursting, gas rich galaxy.

- [Extinction in the 11.2 micron PAH band and the low L_11.2/L_IR in ULIRGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00676)
    - Using 105 high S/N Spitzer/IRS spectra of star-forming galaxies, we show that the equivalent width ratio of the 12.7 and 11.2 micron PAH bands is independent on the optical depth, with small dispersion of ~5% indicative of a nearly constant intrinsic flux ratio R_int = (f_12.7/f_11.2)_int = 0.377 +/- 0.020.
    - The observed flux ratio, R_obs = (f_12.7/f_11.2)s strongly correlates with the silicate strength (S_sil) confirming that differences in R_obs reflect variation in the optical depth
    - The extinction-corrected L_11.2 is proportional to L_IR in the range L_IR/L_sun = 10^9--10^13. These results consolidate L_11.2 as a robust tracer of star formation in galaxies.

- [Cosmicflows-4: The Catalog of ~10000 Tully-Fisher Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00773)
    - Present the distances of 9792 spiral galaxies lying within 15,000 km/s using the relation between luminosity and rotation rate of spiral galaxies.
    - The sample is dominantly, but not exclusively, drawn from galaxies detected in the course of the ALFALFA HI survey with the Arecibo Telescope. Relations between HI line widths and luminosity are calibrated at SDSS u, g, r, i, z bands, and WISE W1 and W2 bands
    - A value of the Hubble Constant is determined of H0 = 75.1+-0.2 (stat.), with potential systematics up to +-3 km/s/Mpc.

- [SCUBA2 High Redshift Bright Quasar Survey: Far-infrared Properties and Weak-line Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00877)
    - SCUBA2观测：54 high redshift quasars at 5.6< z <6.9. About 30% (16/54) of the sources are detected with a typical 850μm rms sensitivity of 1.2 mJybeam−1
    - QSO Host星系的SFR在90-1060 Msun/yr之间；和2< z < 5的QSO比，在z~6 FIR luminous的QSO更稀少
    - Quasars with submillimeter detections tend to have weaker ultraviolet (UV) emission lines compared to quasars with nondetections: 11%的源有很弱的Lya发射
    - 可能反应了早期AGN-星系演化：broad line region is starting to develop slowly or is shielded from the central ionization source, and has unusual properties such as weak line features or bright FIR emission.

- [The distribution of star formation in galactic bars as seen with Hα and stacked GALEX UV imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00962)
    - S4G星系中bar上的SF分布，用GALEX看772个bar星系；433个有Halpha图像
    - 通过叠加UV图像的方法以及分类的方法：A) only circumnuclear SF, B) SF at the bar ends, but not along the bar, and C) SF along the bar.
    - S0星系中的bar一般只有星系核周SF；棒端的恒星形成主要发生在 early- and intermediate-type spirals
    - Late-type galaxies are mainly assigned to SF class C: we argue that this is a consequence of low shear
    - In bar stacks of spirals, the UV emission traces the stellar bars and dominates on their leading side, as witnessed in simulations. 并且有棒盘星系的中心UV发射会更亮
    - We also show that the distributions of SF in inner ringed galaxies are broadly the same in barred and non-barred galaxies, including a UV/Hα deficit in the middle part of the bar: this hints at the effect of resonance rings trapping gas.

- [A search for H2O masers in 100 active dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01104)
    - GBT观测100个z<0.055矮星系：We detected no new masers down to a limit of ∼12 mJy (5σ).
    - We find, in agreement with previous studies, that masers are preferentially hosted by Seyferts and highly-obscured, [O III]-bright AGNs. Our sample has fewer Seyferts, is less obscured, and is [O III]-faint.

- [The WISSH QSOs project IX. Cold gas content and environment of luminous QSOs at Cosmic noon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01112)
    - We analyse ALMA, NOEMA and JVLA observations of FIR continuum, CO and [CII] emission lines in eight QSOs (LBol>3×1047 erg/s) from the WISSH sample at z~2.4-4.7. We report a 100% emission line detection rate and a 80% detection rate in continuum emission,
    - Sub-millimetre data reveal widespread presence of (one or more) bright companion galaxies around 80% of WISSH QSOs, at projected distances of ∼ 6 − 130 kpc
    - Our analysis reveals that hyper-luminous QSOs at Cosmic noon undergo an intense growth phase of both the central SMBH and of the host-galaxy. These systems pinpoint the high-density sites where giant galaxies assemble, where we show that mergers play a major role in the build-up of the final host-galaxy mass.

- [On the impact of baryons on the halo mass function, bias, and cluster cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01775)
    - **Relevant**
    - 基于Magneticum模拟：We show that the impact of baryons on the halo mass function can be recasted in terms on a variation of the mass of the halos simulated with pure N-body, when baryonic effects are included.
    - The halo mass function and halo bias are only indirectly affected. Finally, we demonstrate that neglecting baryonic effects on halos mass function and bias would significantly alter the inference of cosmological parameters from high-sensitivity next-generations surveys of galaxy clusters.

- [Cross-correlating radio continuum surveys and CMB lensing: constraining redshift distributions, galaxy bias and cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01817)
    - LoTSS galaxy overdensity的harmonic-space auto-power spectrum，以及与Planck CMB的lensing cross correlation: We report a ∼5σ detection of the cross-correlation.
    - We show that the combination of the clustering power spectrum and CMB lensing cross-correlation allows us to place constraints on the high-redshift tail of the redshift distribution, one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the use of continuum surveys for cosmology
    - Although the ability of CMB lensing to constrain the width and tail of the redshift distribution could also be valuable for the analysis of current and future photometric weak lensing surveys, we show that its performance relies strongly on the redshift evolution of the galaxy bias

- [Revisiting the complex nuclear region of NGC 6240 with Chandra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01824)
    - Chandra观测，the hard spectral continuum (5.5-5.9 keV), the redshifted Fe I K alpha line (6.0-6.4 keV), and the redshifted Fe XXV line (6.4-6.7 keV)
    - We find significant extended emission in both continuum and Fe lines in the 2'' (1 kpc) region surrounding the nuclei
    - The extended Fe I K alpha emission is likely to originate from fluorescence of X-ray photons interacting with dense molecular clouds, providing a complementary view to recent high-resolution ALMA studies
    - We do not find strong evidence of X-ray emission associated with the 3rd nucleus recently proposed for NGC 6240.

- [Totally Metal: A Relationship Between Stellar Metallicity Gradients and Galaxy Age in Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01241)
    - **Interesting**
    - FIRE-2模拟：The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients
    - 两个过程决定了gradient： (1) the steady “puffing” of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations, and (2) extended, late-time star formation
    - This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.

- [A dynamically cold disk galaxy in the early Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01251)
    - We report the presence of a dynamically cold, but highly star-forming, rotating disk in a galaxy at redshift (z) 4.2, when the Universe was just 1.4 billion years old. Galaxy SPT-S J041839-4751.9 is strongly gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.263
    - Interferometric imaging at a spatial resolution of about 60 pc reveals a ratio of rotational-to-random motions of V/σ=9.7±0.4, which is at least four times larger than expected from any galaxy evolution model at this epoch

- [CANDELS Meets GSWLC: Evolution of the Relationship Between Morphology and Star Formation Since z = 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01261)
    - Combining CANDELS (0.8 < z < 2.5) and the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC; z ~ 0), has physical parameters derived using consistent SED fitting with flexible dust attenuation laws 物理分辨率是一样的
    - Our main finding is that disks with SF clumps at z ~ 0 make a similar fraction (~15%) of star-forming galaxies as at z ~ 2. 最大的贡献在z~1
    - Among green valley and quiescent galaxies, the pure spheroid fraction drops since z ~ 1, whereas spheroids with disks (S0-like) become dominant.

- [The rocky road to quiescence: compaction and quenching of quasar host galaxies at z~2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01277)
    - 7个 1.5 < z < 2.8的透镜放大的QSO host星系:We find that the quasar hosts in our sample can be distinguished into two types
        1. Clumpy SF, Re~2 kpc; 平均SFR密度与mm-selected dusty SF星系类似
        2. Passive or compact SB, Re~0.5 kpc; SFR面密度非常高
    - 第二类可能是处于compaction阶段的：For the one system where we probe the mass of the gas reservoir, we find a gas fraction of just 0.06±0.04 and a depletion timescale of 50±40 Myr, suggesting it is transitioning into quiescence.

- [The dynamical state of Abell 2399: a bullet-like cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01400)
    - We apply a Gaussian Mixture Model to the spectroscopic data from SDSS, WINGS, and Omega WINGS Surveys to identify substructures. 能重现两个主要的X-ray concentration.

- [A Spectroscopic Survey of Lyα Emitters at z≈3.1 over ∼1.2 Deg2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01500)
    - Subaru XMM-Deep Survey: Using spectroscopic observations on MMT Hectospec and Magellan M2FS, we obtained a sample of 166 LAEs at z≈3.1 over an effective area of ∼1.2 deg2
    - Significant overdense and underdense regions are detected in our sample, but the area coverage is wide enough to largely suppress the effect from such cosmic variance.
    - Lya LF: At the brightest end of the LF, there is a tentative detection of a density excess that is not well described by the Schechter function. Lya LF在2< z < 5演化不大
    - Composite光谱里探测到了NVI和CIV发射线，说明发射场很硬

- [The stellar halos of ETGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations: II. Accretion, merger history, and dark halo connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01823)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    - We use a sample of 1114 ETGs in the TNG100 simulation with stellar masses 10^10.3≤M∗/M⊙≤10^12, selected at z=0 within the range of g-r colour and lambda-ellipticity diagram populated by observed ETGs.
    - Low-mass ETGs have characteristic peaked rotation profiles and near-oblate shapes with rounder halos that are completely driven by the in-situ stars. At high fex major mergers decrease the in-situ peak in rotation velocity, flatten the V∗/σ∗(R) profiles, and increase the triaxiality of the stellar halos.
    - Kinematic transition radii do not trace the transition between in-situ and ex-situ dominated regions, but for systems with M∗>10^10.6M⊙ the local rotational support and triaxiality of the stellar halos is anti-correlated with the local ex-situ fraction fex(R) at fixed M∗
    - Merger events dynamically couple stars and dark matter: in high mass ETGs and at large radii where fex≳0.5, both components tend to have similar intrinsic shapes and rotational support, and nearly aligned principal axes and spin directions.

- [HMcode-2020: Improved modelling of non-linear cosmological power spectra with baryonic feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01858)
    - 升级HMcode，提供更精确的non-linear matter power spectrum预测
    - Major improvements include modelling of BAO damping in the power spectrum and an updated treatment of massive neutrinos.
    - 能考虑Baryonic feedback: We also present a simple halo model that can be used to model the impact of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum.

- [Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the projected cross-correlation function between the eBOSS DR16 quasars and photometric galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02308)
    - When cross-correlating the photometric galaxies with quasars in 0.6≤z≤1.2, the cross-correlation function can provide better constraints on the comoving angular distance, DM (6\% precision) compared to the constraint on the spherically-averaged distance DV (9\% precision) obtained from the auto-correlation.

- [A comparative analysis of denoising algorithms for extragalactic imaging surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01846)
    - **Useful**
    - The methods under analysis are Perona-Malik filtering, Bilateral filter, Total Variation denoising, Structure-texture image decomposition, Non-local means, Wavelets, and Block-matching.
    - We analyze in terms of completeness and purity the catalogs extracted after applying denoising algorithms on a simulated Euclid Wide Survey VIS image, on real H160 (HST) and K-band (HAWK-I) observations of the CANDELS GOODS-South field.
    - 和PSF filtering比的优势：The advantage of denoising techniques with respect to PSF filtering increases at increasing depth. Moreover, these techniques better preserve the shape of the detected objects with respect to PSF smoothing.

- [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: the XMM-Newton X-ray source catalog and multi-band counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02193)
    - 932 of the XMM-RM sources are covered by SDSS spectroscopic observations. 89% of them are classified as AGN, and 71% of these AGN are in the SDSS-RM quasar catalog. Among the SDSS-RM quasars, 80% are detectable at the depth of the XMM observations.

- [Molecular Gas Properties on Cloud Scales Across the Local Star-forming Galaxy Population](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01842)
    - **Interesting**
    - PHANGS-ALMA CO (2-1) survey: Consistent with previous studies, we observe a wide range of molecular gas surface densities (3.4 dex), velocity dispersions (1.7 dex), and turbulent pressures (6.5 dex) across the galaxies in our sample.
    - The inferred virial parameters suggest that the kinetic energy of the molecular gas typically exceeds its self-gravitational binding energy at ∼100 pc scales by a modest factor (1.3 on average).

- [Mapping the Escape Fraction of Ionizing Photons Using Resolved Stars: A Much Higher Escape Fraction for NGC 4214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01844)
    - Local analog of high-z SB; 通过forward model分解开的恒星的SED来估计产生的电离光子数量
    - We constrain the local escape fraction by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by stars to the number that are either absorbed by dust or consumed by ionizing the surrounding neutral hydrogen in individual star-forming regions.
    - 光子逃逸率空间变化很大，0-40%；平均也很高，在25%左右

- [Kinematic signatures of nuclear discs and bar-driven secular evolution in nearby galaxies of the MUSE TIMER project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01852)
    - We confirm theoretical predictions of the effects of bars on stellar kinematics, and identify box/peanuts through kinematic signatures in mildly and moderately inclined galaxies, finding a lower limit to the fraction of massive barred galaxies with box/peanuts at ~62%
    - We establish the presence of nuclear discs in 19 galaxies and show that their kinematics are characterised by near-circular orbits with low pressure support, and are consistent with the bar-driven secular evolution picture for their formation.
    - Comparing our results with photometric studies, we find that state-of-the-art galaxy image decompositions are able to discern nuclear discs from classical bulges.

- [The inside-out formation of nuclear discs and the absence of old central spheroids in barred galaxies of the TIMER survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01856)
    - MUSE观测：Nuclear ring是nuclear disc的边缘，两者是同一个结构
    - Nuclear discs are younger, more metal-rich, and show lower [α/Fe] enhancements, as compared to their immediate surroundings
    - Nuclear discs exhibit well-defined radial gradients, with ages and metallicities decreasing, and [α/Fe] abundances increasing with radius out to the nuclear ring.
    - We argue that continuous (stellar) nuclear discs may form from a series of bar-built (initially gas-rich) nuclear rings that grow in radius, as the bar evolves.
    - We do not find evidence for the presence of large, dispersion-dominated components in the centres of these galaxies. This could be a result of quiet merger histories, despite the large galaxy masses, or perhaps high angular momentum and strong feedback processes preventing the formation of these kinematically hot components.

- [Gas-phase Metallicity as a Diagnostic of the Drivers of Star-formation on Different Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01935)
    - We first predict the correlation between SFR, cold gas mass and Z in the gas-regulator frame that the instantaneous SFR is regulated by the interplay between inflow, outflow and star formation.
    - The mean SFR is determined by mean inflow rate and mass-loading factor λ, while the mean Z is determined by the metallicity of inflow gas Z0 and the effective yield (yeff≡y/(1+λ)).
    - The SFR and Z relative to their mean values, denoted as ΔSFR and ΔZ, are found to be negatively (or positively) correlated when driving the gas-regulator with time-varying inflow rate (or SFE).
    - We find that ΔsSFR and ΔZ are found to be, negatively correlated at galactic or sub-galactic scale across galaxy population, and positively correlated at ∼100 pc scale within galaxies.

    - The compact starburst puts most of massive SFGs on the mass--size relation for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z~2 within 300 Myr if the current star formation activity and its spatial distribution are maintained.

- [MeerKAT's discovery of a radio relic in the bimodal merging cluster A2384](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02724)
    - A2384 is a nearby (z = 0.092), low mass, complex bimodal, merging galaxy cluster that displays a dense X-ray filament (∼ 700 kpc in length)
    - By using the MeerKAT observation of A2384, we estimate that the physical size of the radio relic is 824 × 264 kpc2 and that it is a steep spectrum source.
    - This radio relic could be the result of shock wave propagation during the passage of the low-mass A2384(S) cluster through the massive A2384(N) cluster, creating a trail appearing as a hot X-ray filament.
    - This newly detected radio relic is elongated and perpendicular to the merger axis, as seen in other relic clusters.

    - We find no evidence for significant evolution in M⋆, with the intrinsic value consistent with log10(M⋆/M⊙)=10.55±0.1 over the full redshift range: 0.25 < z < 3.75
    - We find that the star-forming GSMF can be adequately described by a single Schechter function over the full redshift range, and has not evolved significantly since z≃2.5. In contrast, both the normalization and functional form of the passive GSMF evolves dramatically with redshift, switching from a single to a double Schechter function at z≤1.5

- [Fewer Mocks and Less Noise: Reducing the Dimensionality of Cosmological Observables with Subspace Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03311)
    - **Interesting**
    - We present a formalism to compress arbitrary observables into a small number of bins by projecting into a subspace that minimizes the log-likelihood error. The lower dimensionality leads to a dramatic reduction in covariance matrix noise
    - Given a theory model, a set of priors, and a simple model of the covariance, our method works by using singular value decompositions to construct a basis for the observable that is close to Euclidean; by restricting to the first few basis vectors, we can capture almost all the signal-to-noise in a lower-dimensional subspace.
    - Unlike conventional approaches, the method can be tailored for specific analyses and captures non-linearities that are not present in the Fisher matrix, ensuring that the full likelihood can be reproduced.

We also present, for the first time, the application of a machine learning-based inference machinery to obtain dynamical masses of around 900 galaxy clusters found in the SDSS Legacy Survey and demonstrate that the inferred masses reproduce the cluster mass function, as predicted by Planck ΛCDM cosmology, down to 10^14.1h−1M

    - The model assumes optically thick continuous outflows like stellar winds, and one key question is how the wind-launched radius is connected to physical processes in TDEs. As one possibility, through a comparison between the escape velocities estimated from their black-hole masses and the wind velocities estimated from observed line widths, we propose that the outflow is launched from the self-interaction radius (RSI) where the stellar debris stretched by the tidal force intersects

- [EDGE: A new approach to suppressing numerical diffusion in adaptive mesh simulations of galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03313)
    - **Interesting**
    - The target galaxy has a maximum circular velocity of 21 km/s but evolves in a region which is moving at up to 90 km/s relative to the hydrodynamic grid. In the absence of any mitigation, diffusion softens the filaments feeding our galaxy. As a result, gas is unphysically held in the circumgalactic medium around the galaxy for 320 Myr, delaying the onset of star formation until cooling and collapse eventually triggers an initial starburst at z=9.
    - Using genetic modification, we produce 'velocity-zeroed' initial conditions in which the grid-relative streaming is strongly suppressed 让高红移的SF更连续，平滑，但最终恒星质量差不多

This latter difference is driven by the large fraction (63%) of FR0s located in groups formed by less than 15 galaxies, an environment which FRIs rarely (17%) inhabit.

    - Our SMGs lie mostly on or just above the main sequence, displaying a decrease in their gas depletion timescales tdep=Mgas/SFR with redshift in the range z∼1-5 and a median of 200±50Myr at z∼2.8.
    - Finally we demonstrate that the Mbaryon-σ distribution of our SMGs is consistent with that followed by early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, providing strong support to the suggestion that SMGs are progenitors of massive local spheroidal galaxies.

    - We estimate that, in the Solar Neighbourhood, ∼1/2 (∼1/3) of the old thin (thick) disc stars can be classified as migrators.
    - Our results suggest that thin/thick discs are affected differently by radial migration inasmuch as they have different eccentricity distributions, regardless of vertical scale heights

    - UV upturn are redder in the optical, more metallic, and their last burst of star-formation happened earlier in time. These differences suggest that UV upturn systems have shorter star-formation histories (i.e. have been evolving more passively) when compared to UV weak galaxies. UV-upturn星系光学颜色更红，金属丰度更高，距离上次星暴时间更长

    - We use Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to show that the observed relations of both ellipticals and spirals arise as the result of (i) a tight galaxy mass-dark halo mass relation, and (ii) the self-similar mass profile of CDM halos.
    - E and S galaxies of given stellar mass inhabit halos of similar mass, and their different scaling laws result from the varying amounts of dark matter enclosed within their luminous radii.

    - A typical redshift z = 6 Lyman Break galaxy, "Althaea" from the SERRA hydrodynamical simulations.
    - We find that the [CII]158um emitting region has an effective radius 1.5 - 2.5 times larger than the optical one, consistent with recent observations. This [CII] halo in our simulated galaxy arises as the joint effect of stellar outflows and carbon photoionization by the galaxy UV field, rather than from the emission of unresolved nearby satellites.
    - This suggests that multi-component systems reported in the literature, which have separations > 2 kpc, are merging satellites, rather than galactic substructures.

- [The GOGREEN survey: Post-infall environmental quenching fails to predict the observed age difference between quiescent field and cluster galaxies at z>1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03953)
    - **Relevant**
    - Star formation histories (SFHs) and mass-weighted ages of 331 UVJ-selected quiescent galaxies in 11 galaxy clusters and in the field at 1< z <1.5
    - We confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more massive galaxies having on average earlier formation times
    - Field里的大质量星系的SFH和星系团里的比更加extended
    - We place this result in the context of two simple quenching models and show that neither environmental quenching based on time since infall (without pre-processing) nor a difference in formation times alone can reproduce both the average age difference and relative quenched fractions.

- [High Molecular Gas Masses in Absorption-selected Galaxies at z≈2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04001)
    - ALMA search for CO (3−2) or (4−3) emission from the fields of 12 high-metallicity ([M/H]~≥−0.72\,dex) damped Lyman-α absorbers (DLAs) at z≈1.7−2.6.
    - We detected CO emission from galaxies in the fields of five DLAs CO气体质量很高，在10^10 Msun量级；The impact parameters of the CO emitters to the QSO sightline lie in the range b≈5.6−100~kpc, with the three new CO detections having b≲15~kpc.
    - The highest CO line luminosities and inferred molecular gas masses are associated with the highest-metallicity DLAs, with [M/H]~≳−0.3\,dex. 高峰度的DLA里有更多的CO
    - The high ALMA CO and C[{\sc ii}]~158μm detection rate in high-z, high-metallicity DLA galaxies has revolutionized the field, allowing the identification of dusty, massive galaxies associated with high-z DLAs.

- [A Broad Absorption Line Outflow Associated with the Broad Emission Line Region in the Quasar SDSS J075133.35+134548.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04193)
    - The discovery of unusual broad absorption lines (BALs) in the bright quasar SDSS J075133.35+134548.3 at z~1
    - 外流气体有高速和低速两个成分：The LV BAL gas very likely have a larger column density and a higher ionization level than the HV BAL gas, and hence a smaller distance than that of the latter.

- [Tracing circumnuclear dense gas in H2O maser galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04214)
    - 30 H2O extra-galactic maser galaxies with their published HCN(J=1-0) and HCO+(J=1-0) observations
    - Normalized H2O maser emission luminosity (LH2O\LCO) and normalized HCO+ line luminosity (LHCO+\LCO). 之间有强相关
    - The sample is also studied after excluding Luminous and Ultraluminous infrared galaxy (U)LIRG sources, and the mentioned correlations are noticeably stronger.

- [The Dynamics of the Wide-Angle Tailed (WAT) galaxy cluster Abell 562](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04265)
    - 星系团速度弥散度 velocity dispersion of 919±116 km s−1. This relatively large velocity dispersion suggests either a very massive cluster (Mdyn>6.9× 10^14 Msun) and/or a merger system
    - Thus, our observations support the model in which a recent off-axis merger event produced the cluster wide conditions needed to shape the WAT in Abell 562.

- [The ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the HUDF: CO Excitation and Atomic Carbon in Star-Forming Galaxies at z=1−3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04348)
    - ASPECS: 22 star-forming galaxies at z=0.46-3.60
    - We infer that the galaxies at z>=2 have intrinsically higher excitation than those at z<2.
    - We derive a neutral atomic carbon abundance of (1.9+/-0.4) x 10^{-5}, comparable to the Milky Way and main-sequence galaxies at similar redshift

- [The Magellanic Corona and the formation of the Magellanic Stream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04368)
    - Here we show that by including this "Magellanic Corona" in hydrodynamic simulations of the Magellanic Clouds falling onto the Galaxy, we can simultaneously reproduce the Stream and its Leading Arm.
    - We predict that the Magellanic Corona will be unambiguously observable via high-ionization absorption lines in the ultraviolet spectra of background quasars lying near the LMC. This prediction is directly testable with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope.

- [SHαDE: Survey description and mass-kinematics scaling relations for dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04453)
    - **Relevant**
    - The Study of Hα from Dwarf Emissions (SHαDE) is a high spectral resolution (R=13500) Hα integral field survey of 69 dwarf galaxies with stellar masses 10^6<M⋆<10^9M⊙. 利用VLT的FLAMES
    - We investigate the logM⋆−logS0.5 mass-kinematics scaling relation, which have previously shown potential for combining galaxies of all morphologies in a single scaling relation. We extend the scaling relation from massive galaxies to dwarf galaxies, demonstrating this relation is linear down to a stellar mass of M⋆∼10^8.6M⊙.
    - An extrapolation to estimate the galaxies' dark matter halo masses, yields a logMh−logS0.5 scaling relation that is free of any bend, has reduced curvature over the whole mass range, and brings galaxies of all masses and morphologies onto the virial relation.

- [Low-scatter galaxy cluster mass proxies for the eROSITA all-sky survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03944)
    - **Important, Relevant**
    - Numerous recent studies have shown that gas mass and core-excised X-ray luminosity exhibit very low scatter at fixed mass. We propose a new method to reconstruct these quantities from low photon count data and validate the method using extensive eROSITA-like simulations.
    - We find that even near the detection threshold of ~50 counts the core-excised luminosity and the gas mass can be recovered with 20-30% precision, which is substantially less than the scatter of the full integrated X-ray luminosity at fixed mass.

- [The XXL survey: XLII. Detection and characterization of the galaxy population of distant galaxy clusters in the XXL-N/VIDEO field: A tale of variety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04049)
    - **Relevant**
    - HSC+VIDEO挑选高红移z_photo>0.8 clusters with X-ray detection：35个候选
    - Although these clusters host galaxy populations that display a wide variety of quenching levels, they exhibit well-defined relations between quenching, cluster-centric distance, and galaxy luminosity.
    - The brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) within our sample display colours consistent with a bimodal population composed of an old and red subsample together with a bluer, more diverse subsample.

- [Multi-timescale reverberation mapping of Mrk 335](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03908)
    - Featureless `hard lags' not associated with reverberation, and often interpreted as propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations, dominate the longer timescale variability.
    - 多时标时间延迟建模：We model the hard lags as fluctuations in the slope and strength of the illuminating spectrum, and self-consistently account for the effects that these fluctuations have on the reverberation lags

- [The Three Hundred Project: quest of clusters of galaxies morphology and dynamical state through Zernike Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04565)
    - we apply, for the first time, the Zernike polynomial decomposition, a common analytic approach mostly used in adaptive optics to recover aberrated radiation wavefronts at the telescopes pupil plane.
    - 改进X-ray图像和tSZ数据，可以推测动力学状态
    - 用300模拟项目测试：We verify that it is possible to discriminate the morphology of each cluster by estimating the contribution of the different polynomials to the fit of the map.

- [Dependence of the dynamical properties of light-cone simulation dark matter halos on their environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04914)
    - We find a strong dependence of halo properties on their environment, confirming that isolated halos are more aspherical and more prolate with lower spin values.
    - Correlations between halo properties exist and are mostly independent of halo environment.
    - Halo spins are aligned with the minor axis, regardless of halo shape.
    - Close halo neighbors have their major axes statistically aligned, while they show a slight but statistically significant preference for anti-parallel spin directions.

- [An excess of small-scale gravitational lenses observed in galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04914)
    - **Interesting**
    - An apt metric, the probability of strong lensing events produced by dark matter substructure, is devised and computed for 11 galaxy clusters.
    - We report that observed cluster substructures are more efficient lenses than predicted by CDM simulations, by more than an order of magnitude

- [The intrinsic reddening of the Magellanic Clouds as traced by background galaxies -- II. The Small Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04480)
    - SMC的消光map：~34 deg2 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) derived using optical (ugriz) and near-infrared (IR; YJKs)
    - We find statistically significant enhanced levels of reddening associated with the main body of the SMC compared with regions in the outskirts [ΔE(B−V)≃0.3 mag].
    - In contrast, we find significant discrepancies between our results and maps created using old stars or based on longer wavelength far-IR dust emission that could stem from biased samples in the former and uncertainties in the far-IR emissivity and the optical properties of the dust grains in the latter

- [On the Environments of Giant Radio Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04482)
    - **Interesting**
    - 利用LOFAR LoTSS巡天的100多巨射电星系GRG和LegacySurvey以及SDSS看GRG所处的环境，附近700 kpc内的星系overdensity
    - Our results show that the properties of satellites around GRGs are consistent with that around the two control samples.
    - GRG在环境上并没有特殊性，indicating that galaxy environments play little role on the origins of GRGs
    - Regarding radio feedback, we show that the fraction of blue satellites does not correlate with the GRG properties, suggesting that the radio jets have minimal influence on the nature of their surrounding galaxies.

- [NGC 6822 as a probe of dwarf galactic evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04482)
    - DEIMOS观测离银河系最近的dIrr星系：The red giant branch (RGB) stars at the galaxy's center are particularly interesting because they are aligned on an axis perpendicular to the galaxy's more extended HI disk.
    - We measured the rotation velocity (v) and velocity dispersion (σ) of the RGB population in five metallicity bins. We found an increase of rotation support (v/σ) with increasing metallicity, driven primarily by decreasing dispersion.
    - 金属丰度随半径下降：While the inverted metallicity gradient-like could be interpreted as evidence for an outside-in formation scenario, it may instead indicate that stellar feedback disturbed a centrally star forming galaxy over time.

- [SkyMapper colours of Seyfert galaxies and Changing-Look AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04688)
    - We find that the u−v index, built from the ultraviolet u and violet v filters, separates normal galaxies, starburst galaxies and type-1 AGN. This u−v index is not sensitive to age or metallicity in a stellar population but is instead a quenching-and-bursting indicator in galaxies and detects power-law continua in type-1 AGN
    - We identify 46 Changing-Look AGN candidates in our sample, one of which has been reported as a type-IIn supernova. We show that this transient persists for at least five years and marks a flare in a Seyfert-1 period of a new Changing-Look AGN.

- [ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey: an ALMA galaxy signposting a MUSE galaxy group at z=4.3 behind 'El Gordo'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04838)

    - MUSE在z=0.87的El Gordo背后发现了一个z=4.32的星系群：associated with a 1.2 mm source which is at a 2.07+/-0.88 kpc projected distance from one of the group galaxies
    - The four members of the MUSE galaxy group have low to intermediate stellar masses (~ 10^7-10^{10} Msun) and star formation rates (SFRs) of 0.4-24 Msun/yr, resulting in high specific SFRs (sSFRs) for two of them, which suggest that these galaxies are growing fast 星系群中星系质量较低，但在快速成长中
    - 作者认为ALMA看到的一些看似孤立的Submm源很可能象征了高红移的富恒星形成星系环境
