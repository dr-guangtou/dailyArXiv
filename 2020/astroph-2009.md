- [A consistent and robust measurement of the thermal state of the IGM at 2≤z≤4 from a large sample of Lyα forest spectra: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00016)
    - thermal IGM evolution code CITE 处理模拟，生成mock光谱校准方法
    - The thermal parameters inferred from our measurements of the flux power spectrum, Doppler parameter distribution, as well as wavelet and curvature statistics agree well within their respective errors and all clearly show the peak in temperature and minimum in slope of the temperature density relation expected from HeII reionization.
    - The peak in the temperature evolution occurs at z≈3, in agreement with previous measurements that had suggested the presence of such a peak, albeit with a large scatter.

- [Harnessing the Population Statistics of Subhalos to Search for Annihilating Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00021)
    - 探测银河系中没有恒星成分的小halo的方法：search for individual unassociated gamma-ray sources with properties consistent with the dark matter expectation 但排除其他天体物理起源很难
    - we present a complementary approach that harnesses information about the entire population of subhalos-such as their spatial and mass distribution in the Galaxy-to search for a signal of annihilating dark matter
    - We show that the collective emission from subhalos can imprint itself in a unique way on the statistics of observed photons, even when individual subhalos may be too dim to be resolved on their own.

- [KiDS+VIKING-450: Consistency tests for cosmic shear tomography with a colour-based split of source galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00367)
    - On the modelling side, we examine the observational nuisance parameters, specifically those for the redshift calibration and intrinsic alignments, using a Bayesian analysis with dedicated test parameters. We verify that the current nuisance parameters are sufficient for the KV450 data to capture residual systematics

- [Forward modeling the multiwavelength properties of Active Galactic Nuclei: application to X-ray and WISE mid-infrared samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - 研究不同电磁波段挑选的AGN有何不同的模型：The core of the model are observationally derived probabilites on the occupation of galaxies by X-ray selected AGN. These are used to seed mock galaxies drawn from stellar-mass functions with accretion events and then associate them with spectral energy distributions that describe both the stellar and AGN emission components.
    - WISE挑选的AGN里主要的污染来自z<0.5的恒星形成星系
    - 模型没有很好的重现X-ray weak的AGN

- [Beyond halo mass: the role of vorticity-rich filaments in quenching galaxy mass assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00013)
    - **Relevant**
    - Horizon-AGN+DISPERSE看halo assembly堆在cosmic web中位置的依赖: we detect a direct and non-negligible influence of cosmic filaments.
    - 接近filament一般意味着恒星质量聚集的enhance；但在filaments的边缘也看到了SF被抑制的迹象 (filament边缘整体角动量高，气体从halo外向中心输送的效率被降低)
    - We find clues for compaction of the stellar distribution at close proximity to filaments.

- [Observing the stellar halo of Andromeda in cosmological simulations: the Auriga2PAndAS pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - **CSST**
    - 通过细致的mock observation比较Auriga模拟和M31恒星晕的PAndAS观测
    - We show that the simulations are overall compatible with the observations. Nevertheless, some systematic differences exist, such as a preponderance for metal-rich stars in the mocks. While these differences could suggest that M31 had a different accretion history or has a different mass compared to the simulated systems, it is more likely a consequence of an under-quenching of the star formation history of galaxies, related to the resolution of the Auriga simulations.

- [RELICS: A Candidate z~6.8 Strong [OIII] emitter and Other Properties of z>5.5 Galaxies Inferred from Spitzer and Hubble Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00020)
    - 184个6 < z < 8星系候选：恒星质量在10^6-8 Msun之间；While our sample is mostly comprised of LUV/L∗UV<1 galaxies, there are a number of brighter objects in the sample, extending to LUV/L∗UV∼2
    - Among these is PLCKG287+32-2013, one of the brightest z∼7 candidates known (AB mag 24.9) with a Spitzer 3.6μm flux excess suggesting strong [OIII] + H-β emission

- [The web of the Giant: spectroscopic confirmation of a Large Scale Structure around the z=6.31 quasar SDSS~J1030+0524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00024)
    - The structure is populated by at least six members, four Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and two Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs). 分布在视线方向上5 pMpc范围内
    - The spectral properties of the six member galaxies (Lyalpha strength and UV luminosity) are similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts.
    - Our finding lends support to the idea that the most distant and massive black holes form and grow within massive (>10^{12} Msun) dark matter halos in large scale structures

- [Power Spectrum of Intrinsic Alignments of Galaxies in IllustrisTNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00276)
    - **SSST**
    - 3-D intrinsic alignment power spectra between galaxy shape/spin and tidal field across 0.1< k/hMpc−1<60 using cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Illustris-TNG300, at redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 2.
    - The shape-tidal field alignment increases with galaxy mass and the linear alignment coefficient AIA, defined with respect to the primordial tidal field, is found to have weak redshift dependence.
    - We also show a promising detection of the shape/spin-tidal field alignments for stellar mass limited samples and a weak or almost null signal for star-forming galaxies for the TNG300 volume
    - The shape of massive disk- and spheroid-galaxies tend to align with the tidal field. The spin of the low-mass spheroids tend to be parallel with the filament, while the spin of disks and massive spheroids tend to be perpendicular to the filament.

- [Elemental Abundances in M31: Properties of the Inner Stellar Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00529)
    - We have increased the sample size of [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] measurements from 101 to a total of 229 individual M31 RGB stars.
    - Inner halo: ⟨[Fe/H]⟩ = −1.08 ± 0.04 and ⟨[α/Fe]⟩ = 0.40 ± 0.03
    - Between 8--34 kpc, the inner halo has a steep [Fe/H] gradient (−0.025 ± 0.002 dex kpc−1) and negligible [α/Fe] gradient, where substructure in the inner halo is systematically more metal-rich than the smooth component of the halo at a given projected distance.

### Sep 2

- [Dark Matter Density Profiles in Dwarf Galaxies: Linking Jeans Modeling Systematics and Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00613)
    - We apply spherical Jeans modeling to simulated stellar kinematic data of spherical, isotropic dwarf galaxies with the goal of identifying the future observational directions
    - We use mock observation to demonstrate the difficulty in constraining the inner core/cusp of the dark matter distribution with datasets of fewer than 10,000 stars.

- [MOONS: The New Multi-Object Spectrograph for the VLT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00628)
    - The collecting power of an 8-m telescope, 1000 fibres with individual robotic positioners, and both low- and high-resolution simultaneous spectral coverage across the 0.64-1.8 micron wavelength range.

- [Stellar initial mass function variation in massive early-type galaxies: the potential role of the deuterium abundance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00616)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - We demonstrate that the abundance of deuterium in the birth clouds of forming stars may be important in setting the IMF.
    - We use models of disc accretion onto low-mass protostars to show that those forming from deuterium-poor gas are expected to have zero-age main sequence masses significantly lower than those forming from primordial (high deuterium fraction) material.
    - Using the EAGLE simulation we show that stellar mass loss-induced deuterium variations are strongest in the same regions where IMF variations are observed: at the centres of the most massive, metal-rich, passive galaxies

- [CLEAR: Paschen-β Star Formation Rates and Dust Attenuation of Low Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00617)
    - 32个HST G141 grism观测的近邻星系：Many of the galaxies in the sample have significantly higher Paβ emission than expected from the star formation rates (SFRs) measured from their (attenuation-corrected) UV continuum or Hα emission
    - 说明Paβ线解释了之前隐藏的SF；Galaxies with lower stellar mass tend to have more scatter in their ratio of Paβ to attenuation-corrected UV SFRs. 说明bursty SFH
    - These results show that Paβ is a valuable tracer of a galaxy's star formation rate, often revealing star formation that is otherwise missed by UV and optical tracers.

- [Yonsei Evolutionary Population Synthesis (YEPS) Model. III. Surface Brightness Fluctuation of Normal and Helium-enhanced Simple Stellar Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00625)
    - **Relevant**
    - Present an evolutionary population synthesis model of the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) for normal and He-enriched simple stellar populations (SSPs)
    - He-rich产生更热的水平支恒星和更亮的红团簇恒星
    - We show that the SBF magnitudes are affected by He-rich populations at least ∼0.3~mag even in I- and near-IR bands at given colors, from which the SBF-based distances are often derived
    - We propose that when combined with independent metallicity and age indicators such as Mg2 and Hβ, the UV and optical SBFs can readily detect underlying He-rich populations in unresolved stellar systems at a distance out to ≳20 Mpc

- [MOONS Surveys of the Milky Way and its Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00635)
    - MOONS will observe up to 1000 targets across a 25-arcminute field of view in the optical and near-infrared (0.6-1.8 micron) simultaneously. A high-resolution (R~19700) setting in the H band has been designed for the accurate determination of stellar abundances such as alpha, light, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements.

- [A Novel Machine Learning Approach to Disentangle Multi-Temperature Regions in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00625)
    - Synthetic spectra containing a various number of underlying thermal components were created using well-established tools available from the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
    - We also confirm that the core of the Perseus cluster contains a mix of differing underlying thermal components.

- [MOONRISE: The Main MOONS GTO Extragalactic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00644)
    - Most importantly, by spectroscopically identifying hundreds of thousands of galaxies at high redshift, the MOONS surveys will be capable of determining the environments in which primeval galaxies lived and will reveal how such environments affected galaxy evolution.

- [Models of Distorted and Evolving Dark Matter Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00645)
    - We investigate the ability of basis function expansions to reproduce the evolution of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo, extracted from a cosmological zoom-in simulation.
    - Despite the many possible biorthonormal expansions, it is hard to beat a conventional Hernquist-Ostriker expansion with a moderate number of terms (≳15 radial and ≳6 angular)

- [Tracing the total molecular gas in galaxies: [CII] and the CO-dark gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00649)
    - We explore a method to quantify the total H2 mass (MH2) in galaxies and learn what parameters control the CO-dark gas reservoir 用Cloudy模型看总H2质量和各种观测 [OI], [CI], CO(1-0), [CII], total infrared luminosity 的关系
    - While the H2 traced by CO(1-0) can be negligible, the [CII] 158 micron line can trace the total H2. 70% to 100% of the total H2 mass is not traced by CO(1-0) in the dwarf galaxies, but is well-traced by [CII] 158 micron line
    - A conversion factor for [CII] luminosity to total H2 and a new CO-to-total-MH2 conversion factor, as a function of metallicity, is presented.

- [A homogeneous measurement of the delay between the onsets of gas stripping and star formation quenching in satellite galaxies of groups and clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00667)
    - 结合模拟中的轨道信息和解析模型研究SDSS星系的quenching和ALFALFA星系中看到的gas stripping
    - Our models recover the typical time when galaxies in the satellite population are stripped and quenched: stripping in massive (Mvir ∼ 10^14.5 M) clusters typically occurs at or just before the first pericentric passage, and up to ∼ 4 Gyr later in low mass (∼ 1012.5 M) groups
    - Quenching发生得比气体剥离更晚更慢：Balmer emission lines typically fade ∼ 4 Gyr (6.5 Gyr) after first pericentre in clusters (groups), followed a few hundred Myr later by reddenning in (g − r) colour.
    - 基本就是Slow-then-rapid模型，但是quenching时标更长

- [Gas and Star Formation from HD and Dust Emission in a Strongly Lensed Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00674)
    - We extend an additional molecular gas tracer to high-redshift studies by observing hydrogen deuteride (HD) emission in the strongly lensed z=5.656 galaxy SPT0346-52 with ALMA
    - 只有上限限制：M_H2 < 6x10^11 Msun;
    - 观测 implies a CO conversion factor of αCO<2.2, which is between the standard values for MW-like galaxies and starbursts. These properties confirm that SPT0346-52 is a heavily starbursting, gas rich galaxy.

- [Extinction in the 11.2 micron PAH band and the low L_11.2/L_IR in ULIRGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00676)
    - Using 105 high S/N Spitzer/IRS spectra of star-forming galaxies, we show that the equivalent width ratio of the 12.7 and 11.2 micron PAH bands is independent on the optical depth, with small dispersion of ~5% indicative of a nearly constant intrinsic flux ratio R_int = (f_12.7/f_11.2)_int = 0.377 +/- 0.020.
    - The observed flux ratio, R_obs = (f_12.7/f_11.2)s strongly correlates with the silicate strength (S_sil) confirming that differences in R_obs reflect variation in the optical depth
    - The extinction-corrected L_11.2 is proportional to L_IR in the range L_IR/L_sun = 10^9--10^13. These results consolidate L_11.2 as a robust tracer of star formation in galaxies.

- [Cosmicflows-4: The Catalog of ~10000 Tully-Fisher Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00773)
    - Present the distances of 9792 spiral galaxies lying within 15,000 km/s using the relation between luminosity and rotation rate of spiral galaxies.
    - The sample is dominantly, but not exclusively, drawn from galaxies detected in the course of the ALFALFA HI survey with the Arecibo Telescope. Relations between HI line widths and luminosity are calibrated at SDSS u, g, r, i, z bands, and WISE W1 and W2 bands
    - A value of the Hubble Constant is determined of H0 = 75.1+-0.2 (stat.), with potential systematics up to +-3 km/s/Mpc.

- [SCUBA2 High Redshift Bright Quasar Survey: Far-infrared Properties and Weak-line Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00877)
    - SCUBA2观测：54 high redshift quasars at 5.6< z <6.9. About 30% (16/54) of the sources are detected with a typical 850μm rms sensitivity of 1.2 mJybeam−1
    - QSO Host星系的SFR在90-1060 Msun/yr之间；和2< z < 5的QSO比，在z~6 FIR luminous的QSO更稀少
    - Quasars with submillimeter detections tend to have weaker ultraviolet (UV) emission lines compared to quasars with nondetections: 11%的源有很弱的Lya发射
    - 可能反应了早期AGN-星系演化：broad line region is starting to develop slowly or is shielded from the central ionization source, and has unusual properties such as weak line features or bright FIR emission.

- [The distribution of star formation in galactic bars as seen with Hα and stacked GALEX UV imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00962)
    - S4G星系中bar上的SF分布，用GALEX看772个bar星系；433个有Halpha图像
    - 通过叠加UV图像的方法以及分类的方法：A) only circumnuclear SF, B) SF at the bar ends, but not along the bar, and C) SF along the bar.
    - S0星系中的bar一般只有星系核周SF；棒端的恒星形成主要发生在 early- and intermediate-type spirals
    - Late-type galaxies are mainly assigned to SF class C: we argue that this is a consequence of low shear
    - In bar stacks of spirals, the UV emission traces the stellar bars and dominates on their leading side, as witnessed in simulations. 并且有棒盘星系的中心UV发射会更亮
    - We also show that the distributions of SF in inner ringed galaxies are broadly the same in barred and non-barred galaxies, including a UV/Hα deficit in the middle part of the bar: this hints at the effect of resonance rings trapping gas.

- [A search for H2O masers in 100 active dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01104)
    - GBT观测100个z<0.055矮星系：We detected no new masers down to a limit of ∼12 mJy (5σ).
    - We find, in agreement with previous studies, that masers are preferentially hosted by Seyferts and highly-obscured, [O III]-bright AGNs. Our sample has fewer Seyferts, is less obscured, and is [O III]-faint.

- [The WISSH QSOs project IX. Cold gas content and environment of luminous QSOs at Cosmic noon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01112)
    - We analyse ALMA, NOEMA and JVLA observations of FIR continuum, CO and [CII] emission lines in eight QSOs (LBol>3×1047 erg/s) from the WISSH sample at z~2.4-4.7. We report a 100% emission line detection rate and a 80% detection rate in continuum emission,
    - Sub-millimetre data reveal widespread presence of (one or more) bright companion galaxies around 80% of WISSH QSOs, at projected distances of ∼ 6 − 130 kpc
    - Our analysis reveals that hyper-luminous QSOs at Cosmic noon undergo an intense growth phase of both the central SMBH and of the host-galaxy. These systems pinpoint the high-density sites where giant galaxies assemble, where we show that mergers play a major role in the build-up of the final host-galaxy mass.

- [On the impact of baryons on the halo mass function, bias, and cluster cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01775)
    - **Relevant**
    - 基于Magneticum模拟：We show that the impact of baryons on the halo mass function can be recasted in terms on a variation of the mass of the halos simulated with pure N-body, when baryonic effects are included.
    - The halo mass function and halo bias are only indirectly affected. Finally, we demonstrate that neglecting baryonic effects on halos mass function and bias would significantly alter the inference of cosmological parameters from high-sensitivity next-generations surveys of galaxy clusters.

- [Cross-correlating radio continuum surveys and CMB lensing: constraining redshift distributions, galaxy bias and cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01817)
    - LoTSS galaxy overdensity的harmonic-space auto-power spectrum，以及与Planck CMB的lensing cross correlation: We report a ∼5σ detection of the cross-correlation.
    - We show that the combination of the clustering power spectrum and CMB lensing cross-correlation allows us to place constraints on the high-redshift tail of the redshift distribution, one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the use of continuum surveys for cosmology
    - Although the ability of CMB lensing to constrain the width and tail of the redshift distribution could also be valuable for the analysis of current and future photometric weak lensing surveys, we show that its performance relies strongly on the redshift evolution of the galaxy bias

- [Revisiting the complex nuclear region of NGC 6240 with Chandra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01824)
    - Chandra观测，the hard spectral continuum (5.5-5.9 keV), the redshifted Fe I K alpha line (6.0-6.4 keV), and the redshifted Fe XXV line (6.4-6.7 keV)
    - We find significant extended emission in both continuum and Fe lines in the 2'' (1 kpc) region surrounding the nuclei
    - The extended Fe I K alpha emission is likely to originate from fluorescence of X-ray photons interacting with dense molecular clouds, providing a complementary view to recent high-resolution ALMA studies
    - We do not find strong evidence of X-ray emission associated with the 3rd nucleus recently proposed for NGC 6240.

- [Totally Metal: A Relationship Between Stellar Metallicity Gradients and Galaxy Age in Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01241)
    - **Interesting**
    - FIRE-2模拟：The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients
    - 两个过程决定了gradient： (1) the steady “puffing” of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations, and (2) extended, late-time star formation
    - This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.

- [A dynamically cold disk galaxy in the early Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01251)
    - We report the presence of a dynamically cold, but highly star-forming, rotating disk in a galaxy at redshift (z) 4.2, when the Universe was just 1.4 billion years old. Galaxy SPT-S J041839-4751.9 is strongly gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.263
    - Interferometric imaging at a spatial resolution of about 60 pc reveals a ratio of rotational-to-random motions of V/σ=9.7±0.4, which is at least four times larger than expected from any galaxy evolution model at this epoch

- [CANDELS Meets GSWLC: Evolution of the Relationship Between Morphology and Star Formation Since z = 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01261)
    - Combining CANDELS (0.8 < z < 2.5) and the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC; z ~ 0), has physical parameters derived using consistent SED fitting with flexible dust attenuation laws 物理分辨率是一样的
    - Our main finding is that disks with SF clumps at z ~ 0 make a similar fraction (~15%) of star-forming galaxies as at z ~ 2. 最大的贡献在z~1
    - Among green valley and quiescent galaxies, the pure spheroid fraction drops since z ~ 1, whereas spheroids with disks (S0-like) become dominant.

- [The rocky road to quiescence: compaction and quenching of quasar host galaxies at z~2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01277)
    - 7个 1.5 < z < 2.8的透镜放大的QSO host星系:We find that the quasar hosts in our sample can be distinguished into two types
        1. Clumpy SF, Re~2 kpc; 平均SFR密度与mm-selected dusty SF星系类似
        2. Passive or compact SB, Re~0.5 kpc; SFR面密度非常高
    - 第二类可能是处于compaction阶段的：For the one system where we probe the mass of the gas reservoir, we find a gas fraction of just 0.06±0.04 and a depletion timescale of 50±40 Myr, suggesting it is transitioning into quiescence.

- [The dynamical state of Abell 2399: a bullet-like cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01400)
    - We apply a Gaussian Mixture Model to the spectroscopic data from SDSS, WINGS, and Omega WINGS Surveys to identify substructures. 能重现两个主要的X-ray concentration.

- [A Spectroscopic Survey of Lyα Emitters at z≈3.1 over ∼1.2 Deg2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01500)
    - Subaru XMM-Deep Survey: Using spectroscopic observations on MMT Hectospec and Magellan M2FS, we obtained a sample of 166 LAEs at z≈3.1 over an effective area of ∼1.2 deg2
    - Significant overdense and underdense regions are detected in our sample, but the area coverage is wide enough to largely suppress the effect from such cosmic variance.
    - Lya LF: At the brightest end of the LF, there is a tentative detection of a density excess that is not well described by the Schechter function. Lya LF在2< z < 5演化不大
    - Composite光谱里探测到了NVI和CIV发射线，说明发射场很硬

- [The stellar halos of ETGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations: II. Accretion, merger history, and dark halo connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01823)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    - We use a sample of 1114 ETGs in the TNG100 simulation with stellar masses 10^10.3≤M∗/M⊙≤10^12, selected at z=0 within the range of g-r colour and lambda-ellipticity diagram populated by observed ETGs.
    - Low-mass ETGs have characteristic peaked rotation profiles and near-oblate shapes with rounder halos that are completely driven by the in-situ stars. At high fex major mergers decrease the in-situ peak in rotation velocity, flatten the V∗/σ∗(R) profiles, and increase the triaxiality of the stellar halos.
    - Kinematic transition radii do not trace the transition between in-situ and ex-situ dominated regions, but for systems with M∗>10^10.6M⊙ the local rotational support and triaxiality of the stellar halos is anti-correlated with the local ex-situ fraction fex(R) at fixed M∗
    - Merger events dynamically couple stars and dark matter: in high mass ETGs and at large radii where fex≳0.5, both components tend to have similar intrinsic shapes and rotational support, and nearly aligned principal axes and spin directions.

- [HMcode-2020: Improved modelling of non-linear cosmological power spectra with baryonic feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01858)
    - 升级HMcode，提供更精确的non-linear matter power spectrum预测
    - Major improvements include modelling of BAO damping in the power spectrum and an updated treatment of massive neutrinos.
    - 能考虑Baryonic feedback: We also present a simple halo model that can be used to model the impact of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum.

- [Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the projected cross-correlation function between the eBOSS DR16 quasars and photometric galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02308)
    - When cross-correlating the photometric galaxies with quasars in 0.6≤z≤1.2, the cross-correlation function can provide better constraints on the comoving angular distance, DM (6\% precision) compared to the constraint on the spherically-averaged distance DV (9\% precision) obtained from the auto-correlation.

- [A comparative analysis of denoising algorithms for extragalactic imaging surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01846)
    - **Useful**
    - The methods under analysis are Perona-Malik filtering, Bilateral filter, Total Variation denoising, Structure-texture image decomposition, Non-local means, Wavelets, and Block-matching.
    - We analyze in terms of completeness and purity the catalogs extracted after applying denoising algorithms on a simulated Euclid Wide Survey VIS image, on real H160 (HST) and K-band (HAWK-I) observations of the CANDELS GOODS-South field.
    - 和PSF filtering比的优势：The advantage of denoising techniques with respect to PSF filtering increases at increasing depth. Moreover, these techniques better preserve the shape of the detected objects with respect to PSF smoothing.

- [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: the XMM-Newton X-ray source catalog and multi-band counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02193)
    - 932 of the XMM-RM sources are covered by SDSS spectroscopic observations. 89% of them are classified as AGN, and 71% of these AGN are in the SDSS-RM quasar catalog. Among the SDSS-RM quasars, 80% are detectable at the depth of the XMM observations.

- [Molecular Gas Properties on Cloud Scales Across the Local Star-forming Galaxy Population](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01842)
    - **Interesting**
    - PHANGS-ALMA CO (2-1) survey: Consistent with previous studies, we observe a wide range of molecular gas surface densities (3.4 dex), velocity dispersions (1.7 dex), and turbulent pressures (6.5 dex) across the galaxies in our sample.
    - The inferred virial parameters suggest that the kinetic energy of the molecular gas typically exceeds its self-gravitational binding energy at ∼100 pc scales by a modest factor (1.3 on average).

- [Mapping the Escape Fraction of Ionizing Photons Using Resolved Stars: A Much Higher Escape Fraction for NGC 4214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01844)
    - Local analog of high-z SB; 通过forward model分解开的恒星的SED来估计产生的电离光子数量
    - We constrain the local escape fraction by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by stars to the number that are either absorbed by dust or consumed by ionizing the surrounding neutral hydrogen in individual star-forming regions.
    - 光子逃逸率空间变化很大，0-40%；平均也很高，在25%左右

- [Kinematic signatures of nuclear discs and bar-driven secular evolution in nearby galaxies of the MUSE TIMER project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01852)
    - We confirm theoretical predictions of the effects of bars on stellar kinematics, and identify box/peanuts through kinematic signatures in mildly and moderately inclined galaxies, finding a lower limit to the fraction of massive barred galaxies with box/peanuts at ~62%
    - We establish the presence of nuclear discs in 19 galaxies and show that their kinematics are characterised by near-circular orbits with low pressure support, and are consistent with the bar-driven secular evolution picture for their formation.
    - Comparing our results with photometric studies, we find that state-of-the-art galaxy image decompositions are able to discern nuclear discs from classical bulges.

- [The inside-out formation of nuclear discs and the absence of old central spheroids in barred galaxies of the TIMER survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01856)
    - MUSE观测：Nuclear ring是nuclear disc的边缘，两者是同一个结构
    - Nuclear discs are younger, more metal-rich, and show lower [α/Fe] enhancements, as compared to their immediate surroundings
    - Nuclear discs exhibit well-defined radial gradients, with ages and metallicities decreasing, and [α/Fe] abundances increasing with radius out to the nuclear ring.
    - We argue that continuous (stellar) nuclear discs may form from a series of bar-built (initially gas-rich) nuclear rings that grow in radius, as the bar evolves.
    - We do not find evidence for the presence of large, dispersion-dominated components in the centres of these galaxies. This could be a result of quiet merger histories, despite the large galaxy masses, or perhaps high angular momentum and strong feedback processes preventing the formation of these kinematically hot components.

- [Gas-phase Metallicity as a Diagnostic of the Drivers of Star-formation on Different Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01935)
    - We first predict the correlation between SFR, cold gas mass and Z in the gas-regulator frame that the instantaneous SFR is regulated by the interplay between inflow, outflow and star formation.
    - The mean SFR is determined by mean inflow rate and mass-loading factor λ, while the mean Z is determined by the metallicity of inflow gas Z0 and the effective yield (yeff≡y/(1+λ)).
    - The SFR and Z relative to their mean values, denoted as ΔSFR and ΔZ, are found to be negatively (or positively) correlated when driving the gas-regulator with time-varying inflow rate (or SFE).
    - We find that ΔsSFR and ΔZ are found to be, negatively correlated at galactic or sub-galactic scale across galaxy population, and positively correlated at ∼100 pc scale within galaxies.

    - The compact starburst puts most of massive SFGs on the mass--size relation for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z~2 within 300 Myr if the current star formation activity and its spatial distribution are maintained.

- [MeerKAT's discovery of a radio relic in the bimodal merging cluster A2384](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02724)
    - A2384 is a nearby (z = 0.092), low mass, complex bimodal, merging galaxy cluster that displays a dense X-ray filament (∼ 700 kpc in length)
    - By using the MeerKAT observation of A2384, we estimate that the physical size of the radio relic is 824 × 264 kpc2 and that it is a steep spectrum source.
    - This radio relic could be the result of shock wave propagation during the passage of the low-mass A2384(S) cluster through the massive A2384(N) cluster, creating a trail appearing as a hot X-ray filament.
    - This newly detected radio relic is elongated and perpendicular to the merger axis, as seen in other relic clusters.

    - We find no evidence for significant evolution in M⋆, with the intrinsic value consistent with log10(M⋆/M⊙)=10.55±0.1 over the full redshift range: 0.25 < z < 3.75
    - We find that the star-forming GSMF can be adequately described by a single Schechter function over the full redshift range, and has not evolved significantly since z≃2.5. In contrast, both the normalization and functional form of the passive GSMF evolves dramatically with redshift, switching from a single to a double Schechter function at z≤1.5

- [Fewer Mocks and Less Noise: Reducing the Dimensionality of Cosmological Observables with Subspace Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03311)
    - **Interesting**
    - We present a formalism to compress arbitrary observables into a small number of bins by projecting into a subspace that minimizes the log-likelihood error. The lower dimensionality leads to a dramatic reduction in covariance matrix noise
    - Given a theory model, a set of priors, and a simple model of the covariance, our method works by using singular value decompositions to construct a basis for the observable that is close to Euclidean; by restricting to the first few basis vectors, we can capture almost all the signal-to-noise in a lower-dimensional subspace.
    - Unlike conventional approaches, the method can be tailored for specific analyses and captures non-linearities that are not present in the Fisher matrix, ensuring that the full likelihood can be reproduced.

We also present, for the first time, the application of a machine learning-based inference machinery to obtain dynamical masses of around 900 galaxy clusters found in the SDSS Legacy Survey and demonstrate that the inferred masses reproduce the cluster mass function, as predicted by Planck ΛCDM cosmology, down to 10^14.1h−1M

    - The model assumes optically thick continuous outflows like stellar winds, and one key question is how the wind-launched radius is connected to physical processes in TDEs. As one possibility, through a comparison between the escape velocities estimated from their black-hole masses and the wind velocities estimated from observed line widths, we propose that the outflow is launched from the self-interaction radius (RSI) where the stellar debris stretched by the tidal force intersects

- [EDGE: A new approach to suppressing numerical diffusion in adaptive mesh simulations of galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03313)
    - **Interesting**
    - The target galaxy has a maximum circular velocity of 21 km/s but evolves in a region which is moving at up to 90 km/s relative to the hydrodynamic grid. In the absence of any mitigation, diffusion softens the filaments feeding our galaxy. As a result, gas is unphysically held in the circumgalactic medium around the galaxy for 320 Myr, delaying the onset of star formation until cooling and collapse eventually triggers an initial starburst at z=9.
    - Using genetic modification, we produce 'velocity-zeroed' initial conditions in which the grid-relative streaming is strongly suppressed 让高红移的SF更连续，平滑，但最终恒星质量差不多

This latter difference is driven by the large fraction (63%) of FR0s located in groups formed by less than 15 galaxies, an environment which FRIs rarely (17%) inhabit.

    - Our SMGs lie mostly on or just above the main sequence, displaying a decrease in their gas depletion timescales tdep=Mgas/SFR with redshift in the range z∼1-5 and a median of 200±50Myr at z∼2.8.
    - Finally we demonstrate that the Mbaryon-σ distribution of our SMGs is consistent with that followed by early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, providing strong support to the suggestion that SMGs are progenitors of massive local spheroidal galaxies.

    - We estimate that, in the Solar Neighbourhood, ∼1/2 (∼1/3) of the old thin (thick) disc stars can be classified as migrators.
    - Our results suggest that thin/thick discs are affected differently by radial migration inasmuch as they have different eccentricity distributions, regardless of vertical scale heights

    - UV upturn are redder in the optical, more metallic, and their last burst of star-formation happened earlier in time. These differences suggest that UV upturn systems have shorter star-formation histories (i.e. have been evolving more passively) when compared to UV weak galaxies. UV-upturn星系光学颜色更红，金属丰度更高，距离上次星暴时间更长

    - We use Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to show that the observed relations of both ellipticals and spirals arise as the result of (i) a tight galaxy mass-dark halo mass relation, and (ii) the self-similar mass profile of CDM halos.
    - E and S galaxies of given stellar mass inhabit halos of similar mass, and their different scaling laws result from the varying amounts of dark matter enclosed within their luminous radii.

    - A typical redshift z = 6 Lyman Break galaxy, "Althaea" from the SERRA hydrodynamical simulations.
    - We find that the [CII]158um emitting region has an effective radius 1.5 - 2.5 times larger than the optical one, consistent with recent observations. This [CII] halo in our simulated galaxy arises as the joint effect of stellar outflows and carbon photoionization by the galaxy UV field, rather than from the emission of unresolved nearby satellites.
    - This suggests that multi-component systems reported in the literature, which have separations > 2 kpc, are merging satellites, rather than galactic substructures.

    - Star formation histories (SFHs) and mass-weighted ages of 331 UVJ-selected quiescent galaxies in 11 galaxy clusters and in the field at 1< z <1.5
    - We confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more massive galaxies having on average earlier formation times
    - Field里的大质量星系的SFH和星系团里的比更加extended
    - We place this result in the context of two simple quenching models and show that neither environmental quenching based on time since infall (without pre-processing) nor a difference in formation times alone can reproduce both the average age difference and relative quenched fractions.

    - Here we show that by including this "Magellanic Corona" in hydrodynamic simulations of the Magellanic Clouds falling onto the Galaxy, we can simultaneously reproduce the Stream and its Leading Arm.
    - We predict that the Magellanic Corona will be unambiguously observable via high-ionization absorption lines in the ultraviolet spectra of background quasars lying near the LMC. This prediction is directly testable with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope.

    - We investigate the logM⋆−logS0.5 mass-kinematics scaling relation, which have previously shown potential for combining galaxies of all morphologies in a single scaling relation. We extend the scaling relation from massive galaxies to dwarf galaxies, demonstrating this relation is linear down to a stellar mass of M⋆∼10^8.6M⊙.
    - An extrapolation to estimate the galaxies' dark matter halo masses, yields a logMh−logS0.5 scaling relation that is free of any bend, has reduced curvature over the whole mass range, and brings galaxies of all masses and morphologies onto the virial relation.

    - **Important, Relevant**
    - Numerous recent studies have shown that gas mass and core-excised X-ray luminosity exhibit very low scatter at fixed mass. We propose a new method to reconstruct these quantities from low photon count data and validate the method using extensive eROSITA-like simulations.
    - We find that even near the detection threshold of ~50 counts the core-excised luminosity and the gas mass can be recovered with 20-30% precision, which is substantially less than the scatter of the full integrated X-ray luminosity at fixed mass.

    - We find a strong dependence of halo properties on their environment, confirming that isolated halos are more aspherical and more prolate with lower spin values.
    - Correlations between halo properties exist and are mostly independent of halo environment.
    - Halo spins are aligned with the minor axis, regardless of halo shape.
    - Close halo neighbors have their major axes statistically aligned, while they show a slight but statistically significant preference for anti-parallel spin directions.

    - We find statistically significant enhanced levels of reddening associated with the main body of the SMC compared with regions in the outskirts [ΔE(B−V)≃0.3 mag].
    - In contrast, we find significant discrepancies between our results and maps created using old stars or based on longer wavelength far-IR dust emission that could stem from biased samples in the former and uncertainties in the far-IR emissivity and the optical properties of the dust grains in the latter

    - GRG在环境上并没有特殊性，indicating that galaxy environments play little role on the origins of GRGs
    - Regarding radio feedback, we show that the fraction of blue satellites does not correlate with the GRG properties, suggesting that the radio jets have minimal influence on the nature of their surrounding galaxies.

    - DEIMOS观测离银河系最近的dIrr星系：The red giant branch (RGB) stars at the galaxy's center are particularly interesting because they are aligned on an axis perpendicular to the galaxy's more extended HI disk.
    - We measured the rotation velocity (v) and velocity dispersion (σ) of the RGB population in five metallicity bins. We found an increase of rotation support (v/σ) with increasing metallicity, driven primarily by decreasing dispersion.
    - 金属丰度随半径下降：While the inverted metallicity gradient-like could be interpreted as evidence for an outside-in formation scenario, it may instead indicate that stellar feedback disturbed a centrally star forming galaxy over time.

- [SkyMapper colours of Seyfert galaxies and Changing-Look AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04688)
    - We find that the u−v index, built from the ultraviolet u and violet v filters, separates normal galaxies, starburst galaxies and type-1 AGN. This u−v index is not sensitive to age or metallicity in a stellar population but is instead a quenching-and-bursting indicator in galaxies and detects power-law continua in type-1 AGN
    - We identify 46 Changing-Look AGN candidates in our sample, one of which has been reported as a type-IIn supernova. We show that this transient persists for at least five years and marks a flare in a Seyfert-1 period of a new Changing-Look AGN.

    - The predominant thin-disc population (v_T < 40 km/s) has an IMF similar to traditional (e.g. Kroupa 2001) stellar IMFs
    - Halo stars from the "blue sequence", which are characterised by low-metallicity ([M/H] < -0.6) , however, have a distinct, bottom-heavy IMF, well-described by a single power law with alpha=-2.17 +0.10/-0.17 over most of the mass range probed.

    - Low resolution observations tend to overestimate σCII values due to beam smearing effects that depend on the specific galaxy structure.
    - The primary energy source for the velocity dispersion is due to gravitational processes, such as merging/accretion events; energy input from stellar feedback is generally subdominant

- [A Flexible Analytic Model of Cosmic Variance in the First Billion Years](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05059)
    - We find that cosmic variance in the UVLF is dominated by the variance in the underlying dark matter halo population, and not by differences in halo accretion or the specifics of our stellar feedback model.
    - We also find that cosmic variance dominates over Poisson noise for future high-z surveys except for the brightest sources or at very high redshifts (z≳12).
    - We introduce a new method for incorporating priors on cosmic variance into estimates of the galaxy luminosity function and demonstrate that it significantly improves constraints on that important observable.

- [The Magellan M2FS Spectroscopic Survey of High-Redshift Galaxies: A Sample of 260 Lyα Emitters at Redshift z≈5.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05070)
    - Our sample consists of 260 LAEs and covers a total effective area of more than two square degrees on the sky. This is so far the largest (spectroscopically confirmed) sample of LAEs at this redshift.
    - Most of them have rest-frame equivalent widths between 20 and 300 Å, and more luminous Lyα emission lines tend to have broader line widths.
    - We detect a clear offset of ∼20 Å between the observed Lyα wavelength distribution and the NB816 filter transmission curve, which can be explained by the intergalactic medium absorption of continua blueward of Lyα in the high-redshift spectra.

    - **Important**
    - We establish that the quenching of central galaxies is governed by intrinsic parameters, with central velocity dispersion (σc) being the most important single parameter. 中心星系和大质量卫星星系都是通过内部机制quench的
    - Conversely, low mass satellite quenching is governed primarily by environmental parameters, with local galaxy over-density (δ5) being the most important single parameter.
        - Environmental quenching occurs at over-densities of 10 - 30 times the average galaxy density at z∼0.1
    - Finally, through an analysis of stellar metallicities, we conclude that both intrinsic and environmental quenching must incorporate significant starvation of gas supply.

- [Stellar velocity dispersion and initial mass function gradients in dissipationless galaxy mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05583)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    - We find that dry mergers tend to make the αIMF profiles of ETGs shallower, but do not alter significantly the shape of the distributions in the spatially resolved σlos-αIMF space.
    - Individual galaxies undergoing dry mergers tend to decrease their αe, due to erosion of αIMF gradients and mixing with stellar populations with lighter IMF.
    - ETGs of given σe are expected to have higher αe at higher redshift, unless the accreted satellites are so diffuse that they contribute negligibly to the inner stellar distribution of the merger remnant.

    - We find that buried AGNs may occupy a locus between bright starbursts and pure AGNs in the fAGN-[Ne V]/[Ne II] plane. We identify a modest correlation between fAGN and mergers in their later stages.

    - Several optical AGN appear to be completely consistent with SF in WISE. We argue that these could be low power AGN, or systems whose hosts dominate the IR emission.
    - Based on our findings, we have created a new diagnostic: [W1-W2] vs [\ion{N}{ii}]/[Hα], which has the virtue of separating SF from AGN and high-excitation sources. It classifies 3∼5 times more galaxies than the classic BPT

    - **Important, Interesting**
    - Using a combination of high-quality HI rotation curves and HI/near-IR surface densities, we homogeneously measure the stellar (j∗) and gas (jgas) specific angular momentum for a large sample of nearby disc galaxies. 估计重子物质的角动量
    - We confirm that the j∗−M∗ relation is an unbroken power-law from 7≲ log(M∗/M⊙)≲11.5, with slope 0.54±0.02.
    - Concerning the gas component, we find that the jgas−Mgas relation is also an unbroken power-law from 6≲ log(Mgas/M⊙)≲11 with a steeper slope of 1.01±0.04.
    - Our analysis shows that our most massive spirals and smallest dwarfs lie along the same jbar−Mbar. While the relations are tight and unbroken, we find internal correlations inside them: at fixed M∗, galaxies with larger j∗ have larger disc scale lengths, and at fixed Mbar, gas-poor galaxies have lower jbar than expected
    - We estimate the retained fraction of baryonic specific angular momentum, finding it constant across all our mass range, with a value of 0.7, indicating that the baryonic specific angular momentum of present-day disc galaxies is comparable to the initial specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes.

    - GASOLINE2 模拟中考虑了Clustered SN反馈：Bursty star formation histories and superbubble-driven outflows lead to the formation of kpc-size DM cores when stellar masses reaches M∗>10^6 M⊙,
    - The superbubble model appears more effective in destroying DM cusps than the previously adopted "blastwave" model, reflecting a higher coupling efficiency of SN energy with the ISM.
    - 整体影响：superbubble-driven outflows have a more moderate impact: galaxies have higher gas content, more extended stellar disks, and a smaller metal-enriched region in the CGM.
    - While H I is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within the CGM, Si II and C IV are less extended. O VI is more extended, but its mass is only 11% of the total CGM oxygen budget, as the diffuse CGM is highly ionised by the UVB.

    - Four quasars show exceptionally small Rp ≲0.90 proper Mpc, which could be the result of their young age (<10^4 yr) in the reionization epoch, though statistics is still small.

- [A comparative study of satellite galaxies in Milky Way-like galaxies from HSC, DECaLS and SDSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06882)

    - The satellite LFs can be measured down to MV∼−10, and for central primary galaxies as small as 8.5< log10M∗/M⊙<9.2 and 9.2 < log10M∗/M⊙<9.9, which implies there are on average 3-8 satellites with MV<−10 around LMC-mass ICGs.
    - 和银河系质量的星系比：i) the averaged satellite LFs of ICGs with different magnitude gaps to their companions and of galaxy pairs with different colour or colour combinations all show steeper slopes than the MW satellite LF; ii) there are more satellites with −15<MV<−10 than those in our MW; iii) there are on average 1.5 to 2.5 satellites with MV<−16 around ICGs, consistent with our MW.

- [Barred Galaxies in the IllustrisTNG Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06895)
    - TNG模拟里的Bar星系：about 55% of disk galaxies with stellar mass M∗≈1010.6M⊙ are barred
    - The relation between bar size and total stellar mass is similar to that found in near-infrared surveys.
    - However, the formation of bars is suppressed in galaxies with M∗<10^10.6M⊙ 可能是因为TNG100的分辨率不够研究这些很短的bar
    - TNG100 overproduces relatively short bars (radius ~1.4-3 kpc) with respect to the mass-bar size relation observed in near-infrared surveys.

- [A single galaxy population? statistical evidence that the Star-Forming Main Sequence might be the tip of the iceberg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06931)

- [Upgraded GMRT observations of the Coma cluster of galaxies: The observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07145)
    - These 6.26 arcsec and 2.18 arcsec resolutions observations allow detailed radio structures to be determined of all detected radio sources that show both discrete pointlike and extended morphologies.
    - We find the steepening of the spectra consistent with synchrotron cooling in the majority of sources and the median for spectral indices is -0.78, suggesting that ~59% sources have steep spectra.

- [Large scale simulations of H and He reionization and heating driven by stars and more energetic sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06631)
    - We post-process the hydrodynamical simulation Massive-Black II (MBII) with multifrequency ionizing radiative transfer.
    - The one with an escape fraction that decreases with decreasing redshift yields results most in line with observations, such as of the neutral hydrogen fraction and the Thomson scattering optical depth.
    - Stars are the main driver of hydrogen reionization and consequently of the thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM).
    - The thermal and ionization state of the neutral and lowly ionized hydrogen differs significantly with different source combinations, with ISM and (to a lesser extent) XRBs, playing a significant role and, as a consequence, determining the transition from absorption to emission of the 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen.

- [Correlations between supermassive black holes and hot gas atmospheres in IllustrisTNG and X-ray observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06634)
    - TNG100里的比较：We find prominent correlations between the masses of central SMBHs and the hot atmospheres X-ray properties only in quenched galaxies and find that the correlations become stronger and tighter at larger radii
    - In TNG100 the X-ray temperature (kBTX) of the circum-galactic or intra-group/cluster medium (r≳5Re) traces the SMBH mass with remarkably small scatters (∼0.2 dex).
    - Within the framework of IllustrisTNG, the correlations between the central SMBHs and the atmospheric gas temperature at the high-mass end at z=0 are fundamentally a reflection of the SMBH mass - halo mass relation, which at such high masses is set by the hierarchical assembly of structures

- [Detecting Subhalos in Strong Gravitational Lens Images with Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06663)
    - Using the technique of image segmentation, we turn the task of identifying subhalos into a classification problem where we label each pixel in an image as coming from the main lens, a subhalo within a binned mass range, or neither.
    - On a test set of noiseless simulated images with a single subhalo, the network is able to locate subhalos with a mass of 10^8M⊙ and place them in the correct or adjacent mass bin, effectively detecting them 97% of the time.

- [Extracting the Subhalo Mass Function from Strong Lens Images with Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06639)
    - We use machine learning to circumvent the need for lens and source modeling and develop a method to both locate subhalos in an image as well as determine their mass using the technique of image segmentation.
    - The network is trained on images with a single subhalo located near the Einstein ring. Training in this way allows the network to learn the gravitational lensing of light and it is then able to accurately detect entire populations of substructure, even far from the Einstein ring.
    - With good accuracy and a low false-positive rate, counting the number of pixels assigned to each subhalo class over multiple images allows for a measurement of the subhalo mass function (SMF)

    - A new theory for the hierarchical clustering of dark matter (DM) halos based on stochastic differential equations 和现有的excursion set approach不同
    - We present a stochastic differential equation that describes fluctuations in the mass growth of DM halos, as driven by a multiplicative white (Gaussian) noise dependent on the spherical collapse threshold and on the power spectrum of DM perturbations.
    - Then, we solve the Fokker-Planck equation associated to the stochastic dynamics, and obtain the Press & Schechter mass function as a (stationary) solution.

- [Unveiling sub-parsec supermassive black hole binary candidates in active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06662)

    - Seyfert 1.5 Mrk 915 emerged as possible candidate for a SMBHB; from the subsequent analysis of its light curve we find a period P0=35±2 months

    - ClG 0217+70 hosts one of the largest radio halos and one of the largest radio relics known to date.

    - 8个的sSFR都很低了：Rapid quenching followed these bursty star-forming periods, generally occurring less than 350 Myr before observation, resulting in post-starburst SEDs and spectra for half the sample.
    - The rapid formation timescales are consistent with the extreme star formation rates observed in 4 < z < 7 dusty starbursts observed with ALMA, suggesting that such dusty galaxies are progenitors of these UMGs

- [The MOSDEF Survey: The Evolution of the Mass-Metallicity Relation from z=0 to z∼3.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07292)
    - This analysis crucially utilizes different metallicity calibrations at z∼0 and z>1 to account for evolving ISM conditions.
    - We find significant correlations between O/H and stellar mass (M∗) at z∼2.3 and z∼3.3. The low-mass power law slope of the mass-metallicity relation is remarkably invariant over z=0−3.3
    - We find no evidence that the fundamental metallicity relation between M∗, O/H, and star-formation rate (SFR) evolves out to z∼3.3, with galaxies at z∼2.3−3.3 having O/H within 0.04~dex of local galaxies matched in M∗ and SFR on average.
    - The efficiency of metal removal increases toward lower M∗ at fixed redshift, and toward higher redshift at fixed M∗.
    - Models suggest that the slope of the mass-metallicity relation is set by the scaling of the metal loading factor of outflows with M∗, not by the change in gas fraction as a function of M∗.
    - These results suggest that the processes governing the smooth baryonic growth of galaxies via gas flows and star formation hold in the same form over at least the past 12~Gyr.

- [Surface Brightness Evolution of Galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS Fields up to z∼6: High-z Galaxies are Unique or Remain Undetected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07295)

    - We find a very strong evolution in the intrinsic SB distribution which declines as (1+z)3, decreasing by 4-5 mag arcsec−2 between z=6 to z=1. 但主要是因为选择效应造成的
    - Deep HST imaging is unable to discover all of the most massive galaxies in the distant universe. Through simulations we show that only ∼15\% of galaxies that we can detect at z=2 would be detected at high-z.

    - 在z=0, knots中的质量1.8x10^10 Msun的中心星系比filaments, sheets, voids中的更红，sSFR更低，金属丰度更高
    - Such dependences can be attributed to the fact that the active galaxy fraction decreases along voids, sheets, filaments and knots.

    - We determine that when area is disregarded, all four tools are capable of broadly similar levels of detection completeness, while only NoiseChisel and MTObjects are capable of locating the faint outskirts of objects. MTObjects produces the highest scores on all tests on all four quality measures, whilst SExtractor obtains the highest speeds

    - The broad line region (BLR) emission is intrinsically weak and not likely caused by an intervening absorber.
    - Dust and [CII] emissions put a constraint on the star formation rate of SFR =900−4900 M⊙yr−1, similar to that of hyper-luminous infrared galaxy.
    - The weak-line profile in the quasar spectrum is most likely caused by a BLR which is not yet fully formed rather than continuum boosting by gravitational lensing or a soft continuum due to super-Eddington accretion.

- [Near-Gaussian distributions for modelling discrete stellar velocity data with heteroskedastic uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07858)
    - 关于运动学研究中的谱线非高斯速度特征的问题：The standard solution for measuring non-Gaussianity involves constructing a series expansion (e.g. the Gauss-Hermite series) which can produce regions of negative probability density. This is a significant issue for the modelling of discrete data with heteroskedastic uncertainties.
    - We introduce a method to construct positive-definite probability distributions by the convolution of a given kernel with a Gaussian distribution. Further convolutions by observational uncertainties are trivial
    - Two kernels (uniform and Laplace) offer simple drop-in replacements for a Gauss-Hermite series for negative and positive excess kurtosis distributions with the option of skewness.
    - We demonstrate the power of our method by an application to real and mock line-of-sight velocity datasets on dwarf spheroidal galaxies, where kurtosis is indicative of orbital anisotropy and hence a route to breaking the mass-anisotropy degeneracy for the identification of cusped versus cored dark matter profiles.

    - 在模拟里能加强SN feedback： when PEH is switched on, galaxy models show higher gas outflow rates and have higher loading factors indicative of enhanced SNe feedback.
    - PEH效应： Electrons ejected from dust grain surfaces by far–ultraviolet (FUV) photons are primarily responsible for the heating of the cold neutral medium (CNM) and diffuse atomic hydrogen (HI) regions
        - Those electrons store their kinetic energy in the gas through collision with the different chemical species therein.

    - Galaxies under strong or weak RPS account for around 40% of the HI-rich population at R200, and even beyond R200 in the most massive clusters.

    - Faint and low-mass simulated satellite galaxies are remarkably independent of halo mass, but the most massive satellites are more common in more massive groups.

This approach has the advantage of avoiding photometric measurements, which are challenging and time-consuming in crowded fields.

- [The EDGE-CALIFA survey: exploring the role of the molecular gas on the galaxy star formation quenching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08383)
    - We observe that the deficit of galaxy star formation with respect to the star formation main sequence (SFMS) increases with the absence of molecular gas and with a reduced efficiency of conversion of molecular gas into star
    - By dividing the sample into galaxies dominated by star formation and galaxies quenched in their centres (as indicated by the average value of the Hα equivalent width), we find that this deficit increases sharply once a certain level of gas consumption is reached
    - Our results indicate that differences in the amount of molecular gas at a fixed stellar mass are the primary driver for the dispersion in the SFMS, and the most likely explanation for the start of star-formation quenching.
    - Once a paucity of molecular gas has significantly reduced star formation, changes in the star formation efficiency are what drives a galaxy deeper into the red cloud, retiring it.

    - The star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) correlates with the ISM pressure set by self-gravity (Pgrav) following a power law with an exponent close to 0.8.
    - The molecular gas velocity dispersion values are driven by the ISM pressure set by self-gravity, responsible to maintain the vertical pressure balance.

We call this approach Convergence Acceleration by Regression and Pooling (CARPool).

    - By utilising variational inference, we are able to use the learned GMM as a statistical prior on the latent space to facilitate random sampling and generation of synthetic images
    - AstroVaDEr demonstrates the ability to classify the morphology of galaxies in a human-interpretable way without the need for labelled training data.

    - This approach has two improvements compared to KNN: one is the feature weighted by GA; another is that the predicted redshift is not the redshift average of K neighbors but the weighted average of median and mean of redshifts for K neighbors, i.e. p×zmedian+(1−p)×zmean.

- [The MUSE Deep Lensed Field on the Hubble Frontier Field MACS~J0416](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08458)

    - Near-infrared VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric spectra that spatially resolve the broad Brγ emission line in the nucleus of the active galaxy IRAS 09149-6206.
    - We infer the radius of the BLR to be ~65 μas (0.075 pc), which is consistent with the radius-luminosity relation of nearby active galactic nuclei derived based on the time lag of the Hβ line from reverberation mapping campaigns. Our dynamical modelling indicates the black hole mass is ∼1×10^8M⊙, which is a little below, but consistent with, the standard MBH-σ∗ relation.

- [Dying of the Light: An X-ray Fading Cold Quasar at z ~ 0.405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08465)
    - Cold quasars are a rare subpopulation observed to host unobscured, X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) while also retaining a cold gas supply fueling high star formation rates. These objects are interpreted as AGN early in their evolution.
    - We also find AGN bolometric luminosity that varies as a function of observation method and AGN region probed. Finally, we identify a candidate outflow feature corroborating the hypothesis that cold quasars have energetic feedback.

- [Excitation and acceleration of molecular outflows in LIRGs: The extended ESO 320-G030 outflow on 200-pc scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08481)
    - ESO320-G030 is a double-barred isolated spiral, but its compact and obscured nuclear starburst (SFR~15 Msun/yr; Av~40 mag) resembles those of more luminous ULIRGs.
    - The outflowing molecular gas is less excited than the gas in the nuclear starburst (launching site) and the galaxy disk.
    - The outflowing molecular clouds are not bound by self-gravity.
    - The heating by the hotter ionized outflow phase is not efficient and may favor the survival of the outflow molecular phase.

    - DELVE 2 is identified as a resolved overdensity of old (τ>13.3 Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]=−2.0+0.2−0.5 dex) stars
    - DELVE 2 is detected in Gaia DR2 with a clear proper motion signal, with multiple blue horizontal branch stars near the centroid of the system with proper motions consistent with the systemic mean.

- [SMART: A new implementation of Schwarzschild's Orbit Superposition technique for triaxial galaxies and its application to an N-body merger simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08979)
    - **Useful**
    - SMART fits full line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) to determine the viewing angles, black hole, stellar and dark matter (DM) masses and the stellar orbit distribution of galaxies
    - Our model uses a 5D orbital starting space to ensure a representative set of stellar trajectories adaptable to the integrals-of-motion space and it is designed to deal with non-parametric stellar and DM densities.
    - We show that orbit models even allow the reconstruction of full intrinsic velocity distributions, which contain more information than the classical anisotropy parameter.

    - We find that the implied luminosity ratio, L([OI]63micron)/L(IR), of the undetected BzK-selected star-forming galaxies broadly agrees with that of low-redshift star-forming galaxies, while BzK-21000 has a similar ratio to that of a dusty star-forming galaxy at z~6.

- [The principle of maximum entropy explains the cores observed in the mass distribution of dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08994)
    - We argue that cores are unavoidable in the self-gravitating systems of maximum entropy resulting from non-extensive statistical mechanics. Their structure follows from the Tsallis entropy, suitable for systems with long-range interactions. Strikingly, the mass density profiles predicted by such thermodynamic equilibrium match the observed cores without any adjustment or tuning.

- [Detecting the Figure Rotation of Dark Matter Halos with Tidal Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09004)
    - **Interesting**
    - Triaxial dark matter halos should exhibit steady figure rotation or tumbling motions for durations of several gigayears. The angular frequency of figure rotation predicted by cosmological simulations is described by a log-normal distribution of pattern speed Ωp with a median value 0.15 h km s−1 kpc−1
    - 即便是这么小的figure rotation可以显著地改变被银河系瓦解的小卫星星系产生的星流的轨道
    - For pattern speeds typical of cosmological halos we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Sagittarius-like tidal stream would be altered to a degree that is detectable even with current observations

- [A 60-kpc Galactic Wind Cone in NGC 3079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09047)
    - We detect the wind in FUV line emission to 60 kpc (as inferred from the broad FUV filter in GALEX) and in X-rays to at least 30~kpc. The morphology, luminosities, temperatures, and densities indicate that the emission comes from shocked material, and the O/Fe ratio implies that the X-ray emitting gas is enriched by Type II supernovae.

- [Improving Performance of Zoom-In Cosmological Simulations using Initial Conditions with Customized Grids4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09085)
    -  Starting from the white noise used to seed the structures of an existing initial condition, we cut out a smaller region of interest and use this trimmed white noise cube to create a new root grid. This new root grid contains similar structures as the original, but allows for a smaller box volume and different grid resolution that can be tuned to best suit a given simulation code

- [DM halo morphological types of MW-like galaxies in the TNG50 simulation: Simple, Twisted, or Stretched](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09220)
    - **Relevant**
    - Using an Enclosed Volume Iterative Method, we infer an oblate-triaxial shape for DM halos with a median T≃0.24
    - 将Halo形态分成三类：
        1. Simple halos(36%) establish three principal axes whose ordering in magnitude does not change with radius and whose orientations are almost fixed throughout the entirety of the halo.
        2. Twisted halos(36%) show some levels of gradual rotations between 50 to 100 degs radially.
        3. Finally, stretched halos(28%) demonstrate a stretching in their axes lengths where the ordering of different eigenvalues change radially
    - Therefore baryonic effects make DM halos less elongated. We analyze the impact of substructure on the DM halo shape and confirm that it is subdominant.
    - Halo形状影响卫星星系的分布：Satellites in simple halos are in general closer to the center and are more aligned with the central galaxy's angular momentum. Satellites in twisted halo class, present a bi-modal behavior in the distribution of their angles. Finally, satellites of stretched halos are farther out from the center and are more misaligned.

- [Galaxy And Mass Assembly: A Comparison between Galaxy-Galaxy Lens Searches in KiDS/GAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09493)
    - Comparison between spectroscopic, machine learning, and citizen science identification of galaxy-galaxy lens candidates
    - We find that the three methods -- spectroscopy, machine learning, and citizen science -- identify 47, 47, and 13 candidates respectively in the 180 square degrees surveyed.
    - These identifications barely overlap, with only two identified by both citizen science and machine learning
    - These differences manifest as separate samples in estimated Einstein radius, lens stellar mass, and lens redshift. The combined sample implies a lens candidate sky-density ∼0.59 deg−2 and can inform the construction of a training set spanning a wider mass-redshift space.

    - We construct robust mass models for each cluster to further confirm our redshift measurements using strong-lensing constraints, and identify a total of 311 strongly lensed sources producing 930 multiple images.
    - The final redshift catalogs contain more than 3300 robust redshifts, of which 40\% are for cluster members and ∼30\% for lensed Lyman-α emitters. 14\% of all sources are line emitters not seen in the available HST images

- [Reconciling escape fractions and observed line emission in Lyman continuum leaking galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09882)
    - We find that one-zone density-bounded photoionization models cannot reproduce the emission lines of the LyC leakers since they systematically underpredict the lines of species of low ionization potential, as [OI] and [SII].
    - Introducing a two-zone model, with differing ionization parameter and a variable covering fraction and where one of the zones is density-bounded, we show that the observed emission line ratios and escape fractions of the LyC emitters are well reproduced. The [OI] excess, which is observed in some LyC leakers, can be naturally explained in this model, e.g., by emission from low ionization and low filling-factor gas.
    - We also confirm that a [SII] deficiency can be used to select LyC emitter candidates.

- [Origin of Weak MgII and Higher Ionization Absorption Lines in an Outflow from an Intermediate-Redshift Dwarf Satellite Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09954)
    - Observations at intermediate redshifts reveal the presence of numerous, compact, weak MgII absorbers with near to super-solar metallicities, often surrounded by more extended regions that produce CIV and/or OVI absorption in the circumgalactic medium at large impact parameters from luminous galaxies. 可能是没有直接探测到的矮卫星星系
    - 模拟测试： We find that thin, filamentary, weak MgII absorbers are produced in two stages: 1) when shocked core collapse supernova (SNII) enriched gas descending in a galactic fountain gets shock compressed by upward flows driven by subsequent SNIIs and cools (phase 1), and later, 2) during an outflow driven by Type Ia supernovae that shocks and sweeps up pervasive SNII enriched gas, which then cools (phase 2)

    - We have observed the velocity fields of the sources with WiFeS, an optical IFU on a 2.3m telescope, and fitted them using a simple circular motion model with an external shear.

    - This metadata analysis demonstrates that the TRGB calibration yields smaller H0 values than the Cepheid calibration, a direct consequence of the systematic difference in the distance moduli calibrated from these two methods. This subset reveals a significant 3.4 σ systematic difference in the calibration of Rung 2.
    - Type Ia supernovae are able to anchor Rung 3 with 2 % precision. This study demonstrates that Type Ia supernovae have provided a remarkably robust calibration of R3 for over 25 years.

- [Evolution of Stellar Feedback in HII Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10079)
    - **Important**
    - We use multiwavelength (radio, infrared, and X-ray) data to measure the pressures associated with direct radiation (Pdir), dust-processed radiation (PIR), photoionization heating (PHII), and shock-heating from stellar winds (PX) in a sample of 106 young, resolved HII regions with radii ≲0.5 pc
    - We find that the PIR dominates in 84% of the regions and that the median Pdir and PHII are smaller than the median PIR by factors of ≈6 and ≈9, respectively.
    - We show that HII regions transition from PIR-dominated to PHII-dominated at radii of ∼3 pc
    - Moreover, we show that the total pressure is greater than the gravitational pressure in the majority of our sample, indicating that the feedback is sufficient to expel gas from the regions.

    - Based on the first five low-order Balmer emission lines detected in the composite spectra of these galaxies (Hα through Hϵ), we derive a nebular attenuation curve that is similar in shape to that of the Galactic extinction curve, suggesting that the dust covering fraction and absorption/scattering properties along the lines-of-sight to massive stars at high redshift are similar to those of the average Milky Way sightline 电离气体的消光比恒星连续辐射中得到的要高

    - The ALMA HUDF galaxies scatter roughly symmetrically around the best-fit linear mass-metallicity relation, providing tentative evidence for a flattening in the SFR dependence of metallicity at high stellar mass.
    - There is no significant evolution in the normalization of the dust-to-gas ratio DGR vs. metallicity relation from z∼0 to z∼2

    - We constrain the Lyα EW distribution at z∼7.6, finding a significant drop from z≲6, suggesting an increasing fraction of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the IGM in this epoch.
    - The spatial distribution of the detected Lyα emitters implies the presence of a potential highly-ionized region at z∼7.55 which hosts four Lyα emitters within a ∼ 40 cMpc spatial separation.

    - Using new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near-infrared and optical observations, we show that the active galaxy IC 5063 contains broad radial rays extending to ≳11 kpc from the nucleus. We argue that the bright rays may arise from dusty scattering of continuum emission from the active nucleus, while the dark rays are due to shadowing near the nucleus, possibly by a warped torus.

    - ∼ 80% of the line flux observed at 3mm arises from CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) emitters at z=1-3 (`cosmic noon')
    - At 1.2mm, more than half of the line flux arises from intermediate-J CO transitions (Jup=3-6); ∼12% from neutral carbon lines; and <1% from singly-ionized carbon, [CII]. 说明未来的[CII] intensity mapping面对着非常强的CO背景

    - There is an excess of "green valley" galaxies and an excess of emission-line ratios indicative of a harder radiation field than that generated by star-formation alone.
    - We rule out the hypothesis that FRBs strictly track stellar mass in galaxies (>99% c.l.). We measure a median offset of 3.3 kpc from the FRB to the estimated center of the host galaxies 和其他transient比较，FRB的分布和LGRB不同

    - 这些DOGs generally have high Eddington ratios (λEdd)；moderate intrinsic X-ray luminosities 和其他DOG类似
    - They also present moderate outflows and intense starbursts. AGN feedback的影响还不是很强

    - We detect CO(2-1) emission in galaxies down to stellar masses of log(M∗/M⊙)=10.0. Below this stellar mass, we present a new constraint on the molecular gas content of z∼1.5 main-sequence galaxies by stacking based on the MUSE detections.
    - Assuming a metallicity-based CO-to-H2 conversion factor, the molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratio from log(M∗/M⊙)∼9.0 to ∼10.0 does not seem to decrease as fast as for log(M∗/M⊙)>10.0
    - The inferred molecular gas density ρ(H2)=(0.49±0.09)×10^8M⊙Mpc−3 of MUSE-selected galaxies at z∼1.5 is comparable with the one derived in the HUDF with a different CO selection.

    - We study a sample of local (z< 0.2) star-forming galaxies showing optical nebular HeII emission using the so-called softness diagrams, involving emission lines of two elements in two consecutive stages of ionization (e.g., [SII]/[SIII] vs. [OII]/[OIII]).
    - We verified that the use of the softness diagrams including the emission-line ratio HeI/HeII combined with black-body photoionization models can provide an absolute scale of T* for these objects. 平均温度在60k Kelvin
    - According to our photoionization models, most sample galaxies could be affected to some extent by ionizing photon leaking, presenting a mean photon absorption fraction of 26% or higher depending on the metallicity assumed for the ionizing cluster.

    - The cosmic HI and H_2 densities are roughly equal at z~1.5. The H_2 density then decreases by a factor 6^{+3}_{-2} to today's value, whereas the HI density stays approximately constant
    - The stellar mass density is increasing continuously with time and surpasses that of the total gas density (HI and H_2) at redshift z~1.5. 恒星质量密度的增长不能只用H2的降低来解释，需要考虑HI的吸积和转化
    - A two step gas accretion process: (i) a net infall of ionized gas from the intergalactic/circumgalactic medium to refuel the extended HI reservoirs, and (ii) a net inflow of HI and subsequent conversion to H_2 in the galaxy centers.

    - Most of the outflows have gas densities (log(ne cm−3) 3−4.8), which we speculate could be the result of compression by jet-induced shocks.

    - The new LOFAR data have changed our view of the Kite by discovering two steep-spectrum (α<−1.5) plumes of emission connected to the arcs.
    - A spatial trend of the spectrum along the arcs with evidence of curved synchrotron spectra and a spatial correlation with the X-ray surface brightness.
    - We propose that the Kite was originally an X-shaped radio galaxy whose fossil radio plasma, after the end of the activity of the central active galactic nucleus, has been compressed due to motions of the thermal plasma in which it is encompassed.

- [Spatially resolved star formation and fuelling in galaxy interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11289)
    - 基于FIRE-II的星系对相互作用模拟：We find that close encounters substantially augment cool (HI) and cold-dense (H2) gas budgets, elevating the formation of new stars as a result.
    - This enhancement is centrally-concentrated for the secondary galaxy, and more radially extended for the primary. 对轨道依赖不强
    - We also find that galaxies with elevated global star formation rate (SFR) experience intense nuclear SFR enhancement, driven by high levels of either star formation efficiency (SFE) or available cold-dense gas fuel. Galaxies with suppressed global SFR also contain a nuclear cold-dense gas reservoir, but low SFE levels diminish SFR in the central region.

- [Galaxy-scale ionised winds driven by ultra-fast outflows in two nearby quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11294)
    - We decompose the optical emission from diffuse gas into a low- and a high-velocity components. The former is characterised by a clean, regular velocity field and a low (~80 km/s) velocity dispersion
    - The other component is found to be extended up to a few kpc from the nuclei, and shows a high (~800 km/s) velocity dispersion and a blue-shifted mean velocity, as expected from AGN-driven outflows.
    - The momentum rates of these ionised outflows are comparable to those measured for the UFOs at sub-pc scales, consistent with a momentum-driven wind propagation. Pure energy-driven winds are excluded unless about 100x additional momentum is locked in massive molecular winds

- [Deep optical imaging of the dark galaxy candidate AGESVC1 282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11300)

    - **Interesting**
    - 为了基于Arepo进行pc分辨率的SF模拟设计的Stellar feedback模型：We perform a suite of 32 simulations of isolated Mvir=10^10M⊙ galaxies with a baryonic mass resolution of 20M⊙
    - 光致电离和超新星反馈都可以调控恒星形成，光电加热的效率不够；光致电离产生的SFH比考虑了SN反馈的时候更平滑
    - When all feedback channels are combined, the additional suppression of star formation rates is minor. 但外流速率比只考虑SN的时候低了很多，因为早期的光致电离反馈阻止了SN的成团爆发
    - Our results also imply that the burstiness of star formation and the mass loading of outflows may be overestimated if the adopted star particle mass is considerably larger than the mass of individual stars because this imposes a minimum cluster size.

- [Robotic Reverberation Mapping of the Southern Seyfert NGC 3783](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11358)

- [The dynamics of the broad-line region in NGC 3227](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11418)
    - The results imply that the BLR is a partially ionized, dust-free, spherical shell that is collapsing, supersonically, at the free-fall velocity due to its proximity to a supermassive black hole
    - Assuming radiatively inefficient accretion, the X-ray luminosity requires ~ 10^-2 M_sun/yr. However, the mass inflow rate required to explain the luminosity of the broad H-alpha emission line is ~1 M_sun/yr. 差异说明大部分吸积气体的能量都进入外流了

    - (1) the EFE is individually detected at 8σ to 11σ in "golden" galaxies subjected to exceptionally strong external fields, while it is not detected in exceptionally isolated galaxies, (2) the EFE is statistically detected at more than 4σ from a blind test of 153 SPARC rotating galaxies, giving a mean value of the external field consistent with an independent estimate from the galaxies' environments

- [Mapping the ionized gas of the metal-poor HII galaxy PHL 293B with MEGARA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11600)
    - We detected low intensity broad emission components and blueshifted absorptions in the Balmer lines (Hα,Hβ) which are located in the brightest zone of the galaxy ISM.
    - A chemically homogeneity, across hundreds of parsecs, is observed in O/H.
    - Our IFU data reveal for the first time that the nebular HeII4686 emission from PHL 293B is spatially extended and coincident with the ionizing stellar cluster, and allow us to compute its absolute HeII ionizing photon flux

    - 看QSO吸收线指示的outflow到黑洞的距离： We find that the outflows in more than half of the objects are powerful enough to be the main agents for AGN feedback, and that most outflows are found at R>100 pc.
    - Assuming that all quasars have absorption outflows, we conclude that most luminous quasars produce outflows that can contribute significantly to AGN feedback.

    - A stack of these at the position of known DLAs lead to a 5-σ limit of log[N([FeXXI])]<17.4 (EWrest<22mÅ), three orders of magnitude higher than the expected column density of the WHIM log[N([FeXXI])]<14.5.

- [Long Tidal Tails in Merging Galaxies and Their Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11879)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - Long tidal tails can be briefly divided into three shape types: straight (41\,per\,cent), curved (47\,per\,cent) and plume (12\,per\,cent)
    - The high formation rate of straight tidal tails needs to be understood as the projection of curved tidal tails accounts for only a small fraction of the straight tails.
    - We identify 165 tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), yielding a TDG production rate of 0.36 per merger.
    - These TDGs have stellar masses in the range of 7.5≤log(M∗/M⊙)≤9.5 and appear compact with half-light radii following the M∗ - Re relation of low-mass elliptical galaxies. 只有一小部分也许可以看成UDG

    - We explore unsupervised machine learning for galaxy morphology analyses using a combination of feature extraction and hierarchical clustering (HC) within a novel vector-quantised variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE).
    - 找到了27个星系形态的clusters，对应不同的星系性质
    - Comparing the given clusters with classic Hubble types (ellipticals, lenticulars, early spirals, late spirals, and irregulars), we show that there is an intrinsic vagueness in visual classification systems, in particular galaxies with transitional features such as lenticulars and early spirals.

- [Multitracer cosmological line intensity mapping mock lightcone simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11933)
    - We present a general framework for creating multitracer mock sub-millimeter line intensity maps based on physically grounded galaxy formation and sub-mm line emission models. We simulate a mock lightcone of 2 deg2 over a redshift range 0≤z≤10, comprising discrete galaxies and galaxy CII, CO, CI emission.
    - We show that the star formation rate and line emission scaling relations predicted by our simulation significantly differ at low halo masses from widely used empirical relations 对LIM观测影响很大

    - We report on the performance of 13 photometric redshift code single value redshift estimates and redshift probability distributions (PDZs) on a common set of data, focusing particularly on the 0.2--2.6 redshift range that the Euclid mission will probe
    - The performance of each method is assessed through a set of informative metrics, using cross-matched spectroscopic and highly-accurate photometric redshifts as the ground truth. We show that the rejection criteria set by participants are efficient in removing strong outliers, sources for which the photo-z deviates by more than 0.15(1+z) from the spectroscopic-redshift (spec-z).

- [Probing the Origin of Low Frequency Radio Emission in PG Quasars with the uGMRT -- I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12264)
    - Only four sources reveal extended radio structures on ∼10-30 kpc scales, while the rest are largely a combination of a radio core unresolved at the uGMRT resolution of ∼3-5 arcsec, surrounded by diffuse emission on few kpc to ∼10 kpc scales.
    - We find that the radio emission in the 2 radio-loud (RL) quasars and nearly one-third of the radio-quiet (RQ) quasars is AGN dominated whereas the remaining sources appear to have significant contributions from stellar-related processes along with the AGN.

- [Very Large Array observations of the mini-halo and AGN feedback in the Phoenix cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13238)
    - New Very Large Array 1-12 GHz observations of the Phoenix cluster which resolve the AGN and its lobes in all four frequency bands, and resolve the mini-halo in L- and S-band
    - We find that the mini-halo is most likely formed by turbulent re-acceleration powered by sloshing in the cool core due to a recent merger.
    - We find that the feedback in the Phoenix cluster is consistent with the picture that stronger cooling flows are to be expected for massive clusters like the Phoenix cluster, as these may feature an underweight supermassive black hole due to their merging history.
    - Strong time variability of the AGN on Myr-timescales may help explain the disconnection between the radio and the X-ray properties of the system.

- [Pairs of Giant Shock Waves (N-Waves) in Merging Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13124)
    - Sub-cluster并合中产生的bow-shock持续向星系团外围传播，可能是产生radio relics的机制之一
    - During the same merger stage, a secondary shock is formed much closer to the main cluster center. A close analog of this structure is known in the usual hydrodynamics as N-waves, where the trailing part of the "N" is the result of the non-linear evolution of a shock. 和主shock在并合中成对出现；主shock在射电波段更明显，但trailing shock可能在X-ray波段更明显
    - Coma cluster and A2744 could be two examples in a post-merger state with such well-separated shock pairs.

- [Morphology of radio relics I: What causes the substructure of synchrotron emission?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13514)
    - Merger shocksde 3-D MHD模拟：includes the diffusive shock acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons, their spatial advection and energy losses at run-time.
    - We find that upstream turbulence plays a major role in shaping the properties of radio relics produced downstream.
    - Our simulated spectral index maps and profiles across the radio relic also suggest that the standard deviation of the upstream magnetic field must be relatively small (σB≤1μG) in order to reproduce observations and therefore, radio relics can potentially constrain the distribution of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters outskirts.

- [A Complete Census of Circumgalactic \MgII at Redshift z ≲ 0.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12372)
    - A survey of MgII absorbing gas in the vicinity of 380 random galaxies, using 156 background quasi-stellar objects(QSOs)
    - The projected distances span a range from d=9 to 497 kpc, redshifts of the galaxies range from z=0.10 to 0.48, and rest-frame absolute B-band magnitudes range from MB=−16.7 to −22.8
    - MgII吸收线等值宽度的统计分布和性质依赖：the rest-frame equivalent width of MgII, Wr(2796), depends on halo radius(Rh), B-band luminosity(LB) and stellar mass (Mstar) of the host galaxies, and declines steeply with increasing d for isolated, star-forming galaxies. Wr (2796) exhibits no clear trend for either isolated, quiescent galaxies or non-isolated galaxies.
    - MgII气体的覆盖，对孤立SF星系，在<40 kpc内是60%；在100 kpc附近降低为接近0；覆盖与恒星质量和sSFR有相关
    - We find no strong azimuthal dependence of MgII absorption for either star-forming or quiescent galaxies.

- [Exploring the origin of thick disks using the NewHorizon and Galactica simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12373)
    - Zoom-in模拟里的盘星系： the "thick" disk stars are older, less metal-rich, kinematically hotter, and higher in accreted star fraction than the "thin" disk counterparts. 但薄盘和厚盘都主要由in-situ star构成
    - We find that approximately half of the in-situ stars in the thick disks are formed even before the galaxies develop their disks, and the other half are formed in spatially and kinematically thinner disks and then thickened with time by heating
    - Moreover, as the combined result of the thickening of the existing disk stars and the continued formation of young thin-disk stars, the vertical distribution of stars does not change much after the disks settle, pointing to the modulation of both orbital diffusion and star formation by the same confounding factor: the proximity of galaxies to marginal stability.

    - **Useful, Interesting**
    - We report fluxes for 42 detected emission lines, and upper limits for an additional 22. This galaxy has extreme emission line ratios and high equivalent widths that are characteristic of extreme emission-line galaxies.
    - UV发射线诊断表现不好：We find disappointing performance from the UV--only diagnostics: they either are unable to measure the metallicity or dramatically under-estimate it; they over-estimate the pressure; and the UV diagnostic of ionization parameter has a strong metallicity dependence in this regime.

    - MUSE+ALMA观测外流方向的气体：分子气体外流的去投影速度比电离气体慢，This suggests that the outflowing molecular gas in the galaxy disk is being entrained by the AGN wind.
    - 在外流气体质量和外流速率上，分子气体都占绝对主导：molecular and ionized outflow mass rates of ~51 Msun yr^-1 and 0.14 Msun yr^-1.
    - The wind momentum load for the molecular and ionized outflow phases are ~27-5 and <1, which suggests that the molecular phase is not momentum conserving while the ionized one most certainly is.
    - This suggest that in Sy-like AGN such as NGC 5643, the radiative/quasar and the kinetic/radio AGN feedback modes coexist and may shape the host galaxies even at kpc-scales via both positive and (mild) negative feedback.

- [How to empirically model star formation in dark matter halos: I. Inferences about central galaxies from numerical simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12467)
    - **Relevant**
    - Using a linear dimension reduction algorithm and a model ensemble method, we find that for both star-forming and quenched galaxies, the star formation history (SFH) is tightly related to the halo mass assembly history (MAH).
    - We build an empirical model to predict the SFH of central galaxies based on the MAH of their host halos, and we model the star-forming and quenched populations separately

- [MUSE observations towards the lensing cluster A2744: Intersection between the LBG and LAE populations at z ∼ 3-7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12824)
    - We define three samples of star-forming galaxies: LBG galaxies with an LAE counterpart (92 galaxies), LBG galaxies without LAE counterpart (408 galaxies) and LAE galaxies without an LBG counterpart (46 galaxies).
    - The fraction of LAEs among all selected SFGs increases with redshift up to z ∼ 6 and decreases for higher redshifts.
    - LAE selection is able to identify intrinsically UV faint galaxies with Muv ≥ -15 that are typically missed in the deepest lensing photometric surveys.
    - The LBG population seems to fairly represent the total population of SFGs down to Muv∼-15.
    - There is no clear evidence, based on the present results, for an intrinsic difference on the properties of the two populations selected as LBG and/or LAE.

- [An interesting case of the formation and evolution of a barred galaxy in the cosmological context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13234)
    - Elongated, bar-like galaxies without a significant disk component, with little rotation support and no gas, often form as a result of tidal interactions with a galaxy cluster, as was recently demonstrated using the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation.

- [Highly ordered magnetic fields in the tail of the jellyfish galaxy JO206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13287)
    - JVLA观测
    - We present the first measurement of the magnetic field strength and orientation within the disc and the (90kpc-long) Hα-emitting tail of the jellyfish galaxy JO206. The tail has a large-scale magnetic field (>4.1μG), a steep radio spectral index (α∼−2.0), indicating an aging of the electrons propagating away from the star-forming regions, and extremely high fractional polarisation (>50%), indicating low turbulent motions.
    - 磁场方向与stripping方向一致；模拟显示：the high fractional polarisation and the ordered magnetic field can be explained by accretion of draped magnetised plasma from the hot wind that condenses onto the external layers of the tail, where it is adiabatically compressed and sheared.
    - The ordered magnetic field, preventing heat and momentum exchange, may be a key factor in allowing in-situ star formation in the tail.

- [Disc galaxy resolved in HI absorption against the radio lobe of 3C 433: Case study for future surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13338)
    - HI absorption does not suffer from this dependence on distance as long as there is a bright enough background radio source
    - The resolved kinematics of the absorber, located against the southern lobe of the 3C 433, shows that it has regular kinematics with an HI mass ≲3.4×10^8M⊙ for Tspin= 100K. Host是个10^10 Msun的盘星系，SFR很低，位于SFMS以下
    - Our GTC imaging reveals interesting alignments between Hα and radio emission in the HI companion and in the host galaxy of the AGN as well as in the circumgalactic medium in between. This suggests that the shock ionization of gas by the propagating radio source may happen across tens of kpc.

    - 看能否用GC像星系中心的掉落，并合解释NSC的形成：主要难点是GC能否承受host星系的潮汐场
    - Our analysis suggests that provided the mass-density distribution of background potential is relatively shallow, as in some galaxies with relatively flat surface brightness profiles, the tidal field near the center of galaxies may be shown to be able to compress rather than disrupt a globular cluster at a distance from the center much smaller than the conventionally defined 'tidal disruption radius'
    - Our model indicates that a star cluster could travel to distances much smaller than rt without disruption, thus potentially contributing to the formation of the nuclear cluster.

    - MassiveFIRE模拟里看z=2-6的IRX-beta relation
    - IRX is tightly coupled to the UV optical depth, and is mainly determined by the dust-to-star geometry instead of total dust mass, while βUV is set both by stellar properties, UV optical depth, and the dust extinction law. 关系的scatter主要由intrinsic UV spectral slope决定
    - We argue that the reported `deficit' of the infrared/sub-millimetre bright objects at z>5 does not necessarily imply a non-standard dust extinction law at those epochs.

    - The ultra-faint 3 GHz number counts are found to exceed the counts predicted by the semi-empirical radio sky simulations developed in the framework of the SKA Simulated Skies project, consistent with previous P(D) analyses.
    - The semi-empirical Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) predicts this steeper evolution and is in better agreement with our results.

    - Utilizing the multi-wavelength data over COSMOS, we identify AGN through a variety of diagnostics and find these to make up 23.2±1.3% of our sample, with the remainder constituting uncontaminated star-forming galaxies
    - 但大部分AGN的射电辐射和SF的特征很像：However, more than half of the AGN exhibit radio emission consistent with originating from star-formation, with only 8.8±0.8% of radio sources showing a clear excess in radio luminosity.
    - Our findings imply that ultra-deep radio surveys such as COSMOS-XS constitute a highly effective means of obtaining clean samples of star-formation powered radio sources.

- [Planck's Dusty GEMS. VIII. Dense-gas reservoirs in the most active dusty starbursts at z~3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13538)
    - ALMA, NOEMA, IRAM观测：high-density tracer molecules HCN, HCO+, and HNC in three of the brightest lensed dusty star-forming galaxies at z~3-3.5
    - The three GEMS are consistent with extrapolations of dense-gas star-formation laws derived in the nearby Universe, adding further evidence that the extreme star-formation rates observed in the most active galaxies at z~3 are a consequence of their important dense-gas contents.
    - The dense-gas-mass fractions traced by HCN/[CI] and HCO+/[CI] line ratios are elevated, but not exceptional compared to other lensed dusty star-forming galaxies at z>2 and fall near the upper envelope of local ULIRGs

- [Are Lyα emitters segregated in protoclusters regions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13542)
    - We find that when a large sample of protoclusters is considered, HAEs showing also Ly{\alpha} emission (HAEs+LAEs) populate the same regions as those that do not display the Ly{\alpha} line at z=2.2.
    - We find that at z=2.2 and z=3.0, RT of the ISM produces a strong decline (30-50 per cent) of the clustering amplitude of HAEs+LAEs with respect to HAEs towards the protoclusters centre.

- [Measurements of the z ~ 6 Intergalactic Medium Optical Depth and Transmission Spikes Using a New z > 6.3 Quasar Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13544)
    - 样本很大：32 quasars at 6.308≤z≤7.00
    - 个体差异很大，再电离过程恨不均匀，The large scatter of individual measurements is consistent with previous work, suggesting an inhomogeneous reionization process
    - We obtain a best-fit for the Lyα effective optical depth evolution at z>5.3, τ∝(1+z)^8.6±1.0
    - The Lyβ-based measurements are generally in agreement with the best-fit evolution obtained from Lyα forests.

- [The 2175 Å dust feature in star-forming galaxies at 1.3≤z≤1.8: the dependence on stellar mass and specific star formation rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13582)
    - zCOSMOS中的观测：The excess absorption is well described by a Drude profile.
    - The bump amplitude decreases with the specific star formation rate (sSFR) while it increases moderately with the stellar mass.
    - However, a comparison with local "starburst" galaxies shows that the high-redshift Main Sequence galaxies have {\it stronger} bump features, despite having higher sSFR than the local sample.
    - It is the recent star formation history of the galaxies that determines the bump strength through the destruction of small carbonaceous grains by supernovae and intense radiation fields couple with the time delay of ∼1 Gyr in the appearance of carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch stars.

- [The stellar metallicity distribution function of galaxies in the CALIFA survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13712)
    - **Relevant**
    - We use the stellar metallicity radial profiles retrieved as the first moment of the MDF, as an internal test for our method.
    - Overall, low mass galaxies (logM⋆/M⊙≤10) have broad MDFs (σZ∼1.0dex), with unclear dependence on their morphology; massive galaxies (logM⋆/M⊙≥11) have systematically narrower MDFs (σZ≤0.2dex).
    - We further find there are multi-modal MDFs in the outskirts (∼18per cent) and the central regions (∼40per cent) of galaxies. This behaviour is linked to a fast chemical enrichment during early stages of the SFH, along with the posterior formation of a metal-poor stellar population.

- [Over-density of SMGs in fields containing z~0.3 galaxies: magnification bias and the implications for studies of galaxy evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13843)
    - We report a remarkable over-density of high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (SMG), 4-7 times the background, around a statistically complete sample of twelve 250-micron selected galaxies at z=0.35 是前景星系群halo的透镜效应导致的
    - The magnitude of the over-density as a function of radial separation is consistent with intermediate scale lensing by halos of order 7x 10^{13} Msun, which should host one or possibly two bright galaxies and several smaller satellites

    - **Relevant**
    - 模拟基于一个AMR code：MASCLET
    - 模拟研究大质量星系团中不同质量组分的演化：We have determined the mass assembly histories (MAHs) of each of the mass components and computed several proxies for the instantaneous mass accretion rate (MAR).
    - Major merger对各成分的mass growth有显著作用，但平滑吸积阶段也有很高吸积率的时刻
    - We explored the correlations between MARs, merger events and clusters' environments, finding the mean densities in 1≤r/R200m≤1.5 to correlate strongly with Γ200m in massive clusters which undergo major mergers through their MAH.
    - We find that the gas infalling through the cosmic filaments has systematically lower entropy compared to the isotropic component, but we do not find a clear distinction in temperature.

- [HI intensity mapping with the MIGHTEE survey: power spectrum estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13550)
    - We establish that we can make a statistical detection of HI with one of MeerKAT's existing large survey projects (MIGHTEE) on semi-linear scales
    - With MeerKAT single-dish measurements, we are constrained to scales >1 degree, and this will allow us to set important constraints on the Baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions 可以互补

- [TheHaloMod: An online calculator for the halo model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14066)
    - **Useful**
    - We use this framework to motivate the presentation of a new Python tool for simple and efficient calculation of halo model quantities, and their extension to galaxy statistics via a halo occupation distribution, called \halomod.

- [The best place and time to live in the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13539)
    - We aim at assessing the habitability of the Milky Way (MW) along its cosmic history against potentially disruptive astrophysical transients with the scope of identifying the safest places and epochs within our Galaxy. We also test the hypothesis that long GRBs had a leading role in the late Ordovician mass extinction event (~440 Myrs ago).
    - Until ~6 billion years ago the outskirts of the Galaxy were the safest places to live, despite the relatively low density of terrestrial planets. In the last ~4 billion years, regions between 2 and 8 kpc from the center, featuring a higher density of terrestrial planets, became the best places for a relatively safer biotic life growth.

- [Interpreting Internal Consistency of DES Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14241)
    - **Useful**
    - 关于用Bayesian evidence ratio来比较测量的一致性：since the evidence ratio is prior dependent, the precise translation between its value and the degree of concordance/discordance requires additional information.
    - The most commonly adopted metric, the Jeffreys scale, can falsely suggest agreement between datasets when priors are chosen to be sufficiently wide
    - 在DES的弱引力透镜和成团性测量之间进行比较：We show that the choice of prior could conceal the discrepancies between weak lensing and galaxy clustering induced by such models and that the evidence ratio in a DES-Y1 study is, indeed, biased towards agreement.

- [How do galaxy properties affect void statistics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14751)
    - 最好不要用SFR选择的星系来定义Void：We find that void catalogs built from luminosity-selected galaxies and halos are consistent within errors, while void catalogs built from star formation rate selected galaxies differ from void catalogs built on halos.
    - Our work suggests that voids built on galaxy catalogs (selected through luminosity cut) can be reliably studied by using halos in dark matter simulations.

- [Local and global gas metallicity versus stellar age relation in MaNGA galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14211)
    - We report a positive correlation between the global Zg and D(4000) (an indicator of stellar age), with a slope that decreases with increasing galaxy mass.
    - The local laws have systematically smaller slopes than the global one.

- [On the reliability of photometric and spectroscopic tracers of halo relaxation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14217)
    - 看星系系统弛豫程度的观测代理：We take advantage of the Anderson Darling statistic (A2) and the velocity-segregation (ΔV¯) as our spectroscopic indicators, and use the luminosity gap (Δm12) and the luminosity de-centring (Doff−set) as photometric ones.
    - We find the photometric indicators demonstrate a stronger correlation with the dynamical relaxation of galaxy groups compared to the spectroscopic probes.

- [MUSE Analysis of Gas around Galaxies (MAGG) -- II: Metal-enriched halo gas around z~1 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14219)
    - MgII absorption around 228 galaxies at z~0.8-1.5 within 28 quasar
    - We observe no significant evolution in the MgII equivalent width versus impact parameter relation and in the MgII covering fraction compared to surveys at z<~0.5.
    - 恒星质量和到星系中心距离是主要的影响MgII吸收气体的性质；而且有些MgII吸收系统和多个星系都有关系；致密环境里的MgII气体很复杂
    - Multiple galaxy associations show on average five times stronger absorption and three times higher covering fraction within twice the virial radius than isolated galaxies.
    - Gravitational interactions among group members or hydrodynamic interactions of the galaxy haloes with the intra-group medium as favoured mechanisms to explain the observed enhancement in the MgII absorption strength and cross section in rich environments.

    - Break bulges in red disks: red disk with SF center
    - 在TNG里找类似的: We find that a small fraction (∼4% at z=0; ∼1% at z=0.5) of galaxies fulfill the breakBRD criteria, in agreement with observations. 其中很多都是卫星和splashback星系；整体上这些星系都在quenching过程中，outside-in quenching
    - The breakBRD state is short-lived, lasting a few hundred Myr up to ∼2 Gyr.

    - z~0.4的一个10^11 Msun大质量椭圆星系中的multiphase gas探测：The H2 column density is logN(H2)/cm−2=17.8+0.1−0.3 with a molecular gas fraction of fH2=2−5%
    - The new COS spectrum also reveals kinematically complex absorption features from highly ionized species O VI and N V 而且柱密度很高
    - 假设这些搞电离吸收气体是正在从halo中的高温气体冷却的中间阶段，气体吸积率大致是0.5-1.5 M/yr
    - 星系中没有恒星形成，说明大部分吸积气体都被加热，returned to the hot halo

- [HI study of isolated and pair galaxies: the MIR SFR-M⋆ sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14585)
    - We derive for the first time an HI scaling relation for isolated galaxies using WISE stellar masses, and thereby establish a baseline predictor of HI content that can be used to assess the impact of environment on HI content when compared with samples of galaxies in different environments. 用isolated星系确立baseline
    - The AMIGA sample of isolated galaxies is found to have the lower dispersion: σAMIGA=0.37 versus σPAIRS=0.55 on the MS, σAMIGA=0.44 versus σPAIRS=0.54 in gas fraction, and σAMIGA=0.28 versus σPAIRS=0.34 in HI deficiency.
    - Our results suggest the differences in scatter measured between our samples are environment driven. Galaxies in isolation behave relatively predictably, and galaxies in more densely populated environments adopt a more stochastic behaviour

    - TIGRESS模拟去研究X_CO的变化：varying metallicity, far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, and cosmic ray ionization rate (CRIR).
    - X_CO decreases with increasing metallicity, with a power-law slope of -0.8 for the (1--0) line and -0.5 for the (2--1) line. X_CO also decreases at higher CRIR, and is insensitive to the FUV radiation.
    - As density increases, X_CO first decreases due to increasing excitation temperature, and then increases when the emission is fully saturated.
