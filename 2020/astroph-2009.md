- [A consistent and robust measurement of the thermal state of the IGM at 2≤z≤4 from a large sample of Lyα forest spectra: Evidence for late and rapid HeII reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00016)
    - thermal IGM evolution code CITE 处理模拟，生成mock光谱校准方法
    - The thermal parameters inferred from our measurements of the flux power spectrum, Doppler parameter distribution, as well as wavelet and curvature statistics agree well within their respective errors and all clearly show the peak in temperature and minimum in slope of the temperature density relation expected from HeII reionization.
    - The peak in the temperature evolution occurs at z≈3, in agreement with previous measurements that had suggested the presence of such a peak, albeit with a large scatter.

- [Harnessing the Population Statistics of Subhalos to Search for Annihilating Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00021)
    - 探测银河系中没有恒星成分的小halo的方法：search for individual unassociated gamma-ray sources with properties consistent with the dark matter expectation 但排除其他天体物理起源很难
    - we present a complementary approach that harnesses information about the entire population of subhalos-such as their spatial and mass distribution in the Galaxy-to search for a signal of annihilating dark matter
    - We show that the collective emission from subhalos can imprint itself in a unique way on the statistics of observed photons, even when individual subhalos may be too dim to be resolved on their own.

- [KiDS+VIKING-450: Consistency tests for cosmic shear tomography with a colour-based split of source galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00367)
    - On the modelling side, we examine the observational nuisance parameters, specifically those for the redshift calibration and intrinsic alignments, using a Bayesian analysis with dedicated test parameters. We verify that the current nuisance parameters are sufficient for the KV450 data to capture residual systematics

- [Forward modeling the multiwavelength properties of Active Galactic Nuclei: application to X-ray and WISE mid-infrared samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - 研究不同电磁波段挑选的AGN有何不同的模型：The core of the model are observationally derived probabilites on the occupation of galaxies by X-ray selected AGN. These are used to seed mock galaxies drawn from stellar-mass functions with accretion events and then associate them with spectral energy distributions that describe both the stellar and AGN emission components.
    - WISE挑选的AGN里主要的污染来自z<0.5的恒星形成星系
    - 模型没有很好的重现X-ray weak的AGN

- [Beyond halo mass: the role of vorticity-rich filaments in quenching galaxy mass assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00013)
    - **Relevant**
    - Horizon-AGN+DISPERSE看halo assembly堆在cosmic web中位置的依赖: we detect a direct and non-negligible influence of cosmic filaments.
    - 接近filament一般意味着恒星质量聚集的enhance；但在filaments的边缘也看到了SF被抑制的迹象 (filament边缘整体角动量高，气体从halo外向中心输送的效率被降低)
    - We find clues for compaction of the stellar distribution at close proximity to filaments.

- [Observing the stellar halo of Andromeda in cosmological simulations: the Auriga2PAndAS pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00060)
    - **CSST**
    - 通过细致的mock observation比较Auriga模拟和M31恒星晕的PAndAS观测
    - We show that the simulations are overall compatible with the observations. Nevertheless, some systematic differences exist, such as a preponderance for metal-rich stars in the mocks. While these differences could suggest that M31 had a different accretion history or has a different mass compared to the simulated systems, it is more likely a consequence of an under-quenching of the star formation history of galaxies, related to the resolution of the Auriga simulations.

- [RELICS: A Candidate z~6.8 Strong [OIII] emitter and Other Properties of z>5.5 Galaxies Inferred from Spitzer and Hubble Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00020)
    - 184个6 < z < 8星系候选：恒星质量在10^6-8 Msun之间；While our sample is mostly comprised of LUV/L∗UV<1 galaxies, there are a number of brighter objects in the sample, extending to LUV/L∗UV∼2
    - Among these is PLCKG287+32-2013, one of the brightest z∼7 candidates known (AB mag 24.9) with a Spitzer 3.6μm flux excess suggesting strong [OIII] + H-β emission

- [The web of the Giant: spectroscopic confirmation of a Large Scale Structure around the z=6.31 quasar SDSS~J1030+0524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00024)
    - The structure is populated by at least six members, four Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and two Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs). 分布在视线方向上5 pMpc范围内
    - The spectral properties of the six member galaxies (Lyalpha strength and UV luminosity) are similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts.
    - Our finding lends support to the idea that the most distant and massive black holes form and grow within massive (>10^{12} Msun) dark matter halos in large scale structures

- [Power Spectrum of Intrinsic Alignments of Galaxies in IllustrisTNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00276)
    - **SSST**
    - 3-D intrinsic alignment power spectra between galaxy shape/spin and tidal field across 0.1< k/hMpc−1<60 using cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, Illustris-TNG300, at redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 2.
    - The shape-tidal field alignment increases with galaxy mass and the linear alignment coefficient AIA, defined with respect to the primordial tidal field, is found to have weak redshift dependence.
    - We also show a promising detection of the shape/spin-tidal field alignments for stellar mass limited samples and a weak or almost null signal for star-forming galaxies for the TNG300 volume
    - The shape of massive disk- and spheroid-galaxies tend to align with the tidal field. The spin of the low-mass spheroids tend to be parallel with the filament, while the spin of disks and massive spheroids tend to be perpendicular to the filament.

- [Elemental Abundances in M31: Properties of the Inner Stellar Halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00529)
    - We have increased the sample size of [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] measurements from 101 to a total of 229 individual M31 RGB stars.
    - Inner halo: ⟨[Fe/H]⟩ = −1.08 ± 0.04 and ⟨[α/Fe]⟩ = 0.40 ± 0.03
    - Between 8--34 kpc, the inner halo has a steep [Fe/H] gradient (−0.025 ± 0.002 dex kpc−1) and negligible [α/Fe] gradient, where substructure in the inner halo is systematically more metal-rich than the smooth component of the halo at a given projected distance.

### Sep 2

- [Dark Matter Density Profiles in Dwarf Galaxies: Linking Jeans Modeling Systematics and Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00613)
    - We apply spherical Jeans modeling to simulated stellar kinematic data of spherical, isotropic dwarf galaxies with the goal of identifying the future observational directions
    - We use mock observation to demonstrate the difficulty in constraining the inner core/cusp of the dark matter distribution with datasets of fewer than 10,000 stars.

- [MOONS: The New Multi-Object Spectrograph for the VLT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00628)
    - The collecting power of an 8-m telescope, 1000 fibres with individual robotic positioners, and both low- and high-resolution simultaneous spectral coverage across the 0.64-1.8 micron wavelength range.

- [Stellar initial mass function variation in massive early-type galaxies: the potential role of the deuterium abundance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00616)
    - **Relevant, Interesting**
    - We demonstrate that the abundance of deuterium in the birth clouds of forming stars may be important in setting the IMF.
    - We use models of disc accretion onto low-mass protostars to show that those forming from deuterium-poor gas are expected to have zero-age main sequence masses significantly lower than those forming from primordial (high deuterium fraction) material.
    - Using the EAGLE simulation we show that stellar mass loss-induced deuterium variations are strongest in the same regions where IMF variations are observed: at the centres of the most massive, metal-rich, passive galaxies

- [CLEAR: Paschen-β Star Formation Rates and Dust Attenuation of Low Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00617)
    - 32个HST G141 grism观测的近邻星系：Many of the galaxies in the sample have significantly higher Paβ emission than expected from the star formation rates (SFRs) measured from their (attenuation-corrected) UV continuum or Hα emission
    - 说明Paβ线解释了之前隐藏的SF；Galaxies with lower stellar mass tend to have more scatter in their ratio of Paβ to attenuation-corrected UV SFRs. 说明bursty SFH
    - These results show that Paβ is a valuable tracer of a galaxy's star formation rate, often revealing star formation that is otherwise missed by UV and optical tracers.

- [Yonsei Evolutionary Population Synthesis (YEPS) Model. III. Surface Brightness Fluctuation of Normal and Helium-enhanced Simple Stellar Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00625)
    - **Relevant**
    - Present an evolutionary population synthesis model of the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) for normal and He-enriched simple stellar populations (SSPs)
    - He-rich产生更热的水平支恒星和更亮的红团簇恒星
    - We show that the SBF magnitudes are affected by He-rich populations at least ∼0.3~mag even in I- and near-IR bands at given colors, from which the SBF-based distances are often derived
    - We propose that when combined with independent metallicity and age indicators such as Mg2 and Hβ, the UV and optical SBFs can readily detect underlying He-rich populations in unresolved stellar systems at a distance out to ≳20 Mpc

- [MOONS Surveys of the Milky Way and its Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00635)
    - MOONS will observe up to 1000 targets across a 25-arcminute field of view in the optical and near-infrared (0.6-1.8 micron) simultaneously. A high-resolution (R~19700) setting in the H band has been designed for the accurate determination of stellar abundances such as alpha, light, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements.

- [A Novel Machine Learning Approach to Disentangle Multi-Temperature Regions in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00625)
    - Synthetic spectra containing a various number of underlying thermal components were created using well-established tools available from the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
    - We also confirm that the core of the Perseus cluster contains a mix of differing underlying thermal components.

- [MOONRISE: The Main MOONS GTO Extragalactic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00644)
    - Most importantly, by spectroscopically identifying hundreds of thousands of galaxies at high redshift, the MOONS surveys will be capable of determining the environments in which primeval galaxies lived and will reveal how such environments affected galaxy evolution.

- [Models of Distorted and Evolving Dark Matter Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00645)
    - We investigate the ability of basis function expansions to reproduce the evolution of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo, extracted from a cosmological zoom-in simulation.
    - Despite the many possible biorthonormal expansions, it is hard to beat a conventional Hernquist-Ostriker expansion with a moderate number of terms (≳15 radial and ≳6 angular)

- [Tracing the total molecular gas in galaxies: [CII] and the CO-dark gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00649)
    - We explore a method to quantify the total H2 mass (MH2) in galaxies and learn what parameters control the CO-dark gas reservoir 用Cloudy模型看总H2质量和各种观测 [OI], [CI], CO(1-0), [CII], total infrared luminosity 的关系
    - While the H2 traced by CO(1-0) can be negligible, the [CII] 158 micron line can trace the total H2. 70% to 100% of the total H2 mass is not traced by CO(1-0) in the dwarf galaxies, but is well-traced by [CII] 158 micron line
    - A conversion factor for [CII] luminosity to total H2 and a new CO-to-total-MH2 conversion factor, as a function of metallicity, is presented.

- [A homogeneous measurement of the delay between the onsets of gas stripping and star formation quenching in satellite galaxies of groups and clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00667)
    - 结合模拟中的轨道信息和解析模型研究SDSS星系的quenching和ALFALFA星系中看到的gas stripping
    - Our models recover the typical time when galaxies in the satellite population are stripped and quenched: stripping in massive (Mvir ∼ 10^14.5 M) clusters typically occurs at or just before the first pericentric passage, and up to ∼ 4 Gyr later in low mass (∼ 1012.5 M) groups
    - Quenching发生得比气体剥离更晚更慢：Balmer emission lines typically fade ∼ 4 Gyr (6.5 Gyr) after first pericentre in clusters (groups), followed a few hundred Myr later by reddenning in (g − r) colour.
    - 基本就是Slow-then-rapid模型，但是quenching时标更长

- [Gas and Star Formation from HD and Dust Emission in a Strongly Lensed Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00674)
    - We extend an additional molecular gas tracer to high-redshift studies by observing hydrogen deuteride (HD) emission in the strongly lensed z=5.656 galaxy SPT0346-52 with ALMA
    - 只有上限限制：M_H2 < 6x10^11 Msun;
    - 观测 implies a CO conversion factor of αCO<2.2, which is between the standard values for MW-like galaxies and starbursts. These properties confirm that SPT0346-52 is a heavily starbursting, gas rich galaxy.

- [Extinction in the 11.2 micron PAH band and the low L_11.2/L_IR in ULIRGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00676)
    - Using 105 high S/N Spitzer/IRS spectra of star-forming galaxies, we show that the equivalent width ratio of the 12.7 and 11.2 micron PAH bands is independent on the optical depth, with small dispersion of ~5% indicative of a nearly constant intrinsic flux ratio R_int = (f_12.7/f_11.2)_int = 0.377 +/- 0.020.
    - The observed flux ratio, R_obs = (f_12.7/f_11.2)s strongly correlates with the silicate strength (S_sil) confirming that differences in R_obs reflect variation in the optical depth
    - The extinction-corrected L_11.2 is proportional to L_IR in the range L_IR/L_sun = 10^9--10^13. These results consolidate L_11.2 as a robust tracer of star formation in galaxies.

- [Cosmicflows-4: The Catalog of ~10000 Tully-Fisher Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00773)
    - Present the distances of 9792 spiral galaxies lying within 15,000 km/s using the relation between luminosity and rotation rate of spiral galaxies.
    - The sample is dominantly, but not exclusively, drawn from galaxies detected in the course of the ALFALFA HI survey with the Arecibo Telescope. Relations between HI line widths and luminosity are calibrated at SDSS u, g, r, i, z bands, and WISE W1 and W2 bands
    - A value of the Hubble Constant is determined of H0 = 75.1+-0.2 (stat.), with potential systematics up to +-3 km/s/Mpc.

- [SCUBA2 High Redshift Bright Quasar Survey: Far-infrared Properties and Weak-line Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00877)
    - SCUBA2观测：54 high redshift quasars at 5.6< z <6.9. About 30% (16/54) of the sources are detected with a typical 850μm rms sensitivity of 1.2 mJybeam−1
    - QSO Host星系的SFR在90-1060 Msun/yr之间；和2< z < 5的QSO比，在z~6 FIR luminous的QSO更稀少
    - Quasars with submillimeter detections tend to have weaker ultraviolet (UV) emission lines compared to quasars with nondetections: 11%的源有很弱的Lya发射
    - 可能反应了早期AGN-星系演化：broad line region is starting to develop slowly or is shielded from the central ionization source, and has unusual properties such as weak line features or bright FIR emission.

- [The distribution of star formation in galactic bars as seen with Hα and stacked GALEX UV imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00962)
    - S4G星系中bar上的SF分布，用GALEX看772个bar星系；433个有Halpha图像
    - 通过叠加UV图像的方法以及分类的方法：A) only circumnuclear SF, B) SF at the bar ends, but not along the bar, and C) SF along the bar.
    - S0星系中的bar一般只有星系核周SF；棒端的恒星形成主要发生在 early- and intermediate-type spirals
    - Late-type galaxies are mainly assigned to SF class C: we argue that this is a consequence of low shear
    - In bar stacks of spirals, the UV emission traces the stellar bars and dominates on their leading side, as witnessed in simulations. 并且有棒盘星系的中心UV发射会更亮
    - We also show that the distributions of SF in inner ringed galaxies are broadly the same in barred and non-barred galaxies, including a UV/Hα deficit in the middle part of the bar: this hints at the effect of resonance rings trapping gas.

- [A search for H2O masers in 100 active dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01104)
    - GBT观测100个z<0.055矮星系：We detected no new masers down to a limit of ∼12 mJy (5σ).
    - We find, in agreement with previous studies, that masers are preferentially hosted by Seyferts and highly-obscured, [O III]-bright AGNs. Our sample has fewer Seyferts, is less obscured, and is [O III]-faint.

- [The WISSH QSOs project IX. Cold gas content and environment of luminous QSOs at Cosmic noon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01112)
    - We analyse ALMA, NOEMA and JVLA observations of FIR continuum, CO and [CII] emission lines in eight QSOs (LBol>3×1047 erg/s) from the WISSH sample at z~2.4-4.7. We report a 100% emission line detection rate and a 80% detection rate in continuum emission,
    - Sub-millimetre data reveal widespread presence of (one or more) bright companion galaxies around 80% of WISSH QSOs, at projected distances of ∼ 6 − 130 kpc
    - Our analysis reveals that hyper-luminous QSOs at Cosmic noon undergo an intense growth phase of both the central SMBH and of the host-galaxy. These systems pinpoint the high-density sites where giant galaxies assemble, where we show that mergers play a major role in the build-up of the final host-galaxy mass.

- [On the impact of baryons on the halo mass function, bias, and cluster cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01775)
    - **Relevant**
    - 基于Magneticum模拟：We show that the impact of baryons on the halo mass function can be recasted in terms on a variation of the mass of the halos simulated with pure N-body, when baryonic effects are included.
    - The halo mass function and halo bias are only indirectly affected. Finally, we demonstrate that neglecting baryonic effects on halos mass function and bias would significantly alter the inference of cosmological parameters from high-sensitivity next-generations surveys of galaxy clusters.

- [Cross-correlating radio continuum surveys and CMB lensing: constraining redshift distributions, galaxy bias and cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01817)
    - LoTSS galaxy overdensity的harmonic-space auto-power spectrum，以及与Planck CMB的lensing cross correlation: We report a ∼5σ detection of the cross-correlation.
    - We show that the combination of the clustering power spectrum and CMB lensing cross-correlation allows us to place constraints on the high-redshift tail of the redshift distribution, one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the use of continuum surveys for cosmology
    - Although the ability of CMB lensing to constrain the width and tail of the redshift distribution could also be valuable for the analysis of current and future photometric weak lensing surveys, we show that its performance relies strongly on the redshift evolution of the galaxy bias

- [Revisiting the complex nuclear region of NGC 6240 with Chandra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01824)
    - Chandra观测，the hard spectral continuum (5.5-5.9 keV), the redshifted Fe I K alpha line (6.0-6.4 keV), and the redshifted Fe XXV line (6.4-6.7 keV)
    - We find significant extended emission in both continuum and Fe lines in the 2'' (1 kpc) region surrounding the nuclei
    - The extended Fe I K alpha emission is likely to originate from fluorescence of X-ray photons interacting with dense molecular clouds, providing a complementary view to recent high-resolution ALMA studies
    - We do not find strong evidence of X-ray emission associated with the 3rd nucleus recently proposed for NGC 6240.

- [Totally Metal: A Relationship Between Stellar Metallicity Gradients and Galaxy Age in Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01241)
    - **Interesting**
    - FIRE-2模拟：The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients
    - 两个过程决定了gradient： (1) the steady “puffing” of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations, and (2) extended, late-time star formation
    - This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.

- [A dynamically cold disk galaxy in the early Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01251)
    - We report the presence of a dynamically cold, but highly star-forming, rotating disk in a galaxy at redshift (z) 4.2, when the Universe was just 1.4 billion years old. Galaxy SPT-S J041839-4751.9 is strongly gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.263
    - Interferometric imaging at a spatial resolution of about 60 pc reveals a ratio of rotational-to-random motions of V/σ=9.7±0.4, which is at least four times larger than expected from any galaxy evolution model at this epoch

- [CANDELS Meets GSWLC: Evolution of the Relationship Between Morphology and Star Formation Since z = 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01261)
    - Combining CANDELS (0.8 < z < 2.5) and the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC; z ~ 0), has physical parameters derived using consistent SED fitting with flexible dust attenuation laws 物理分辨率是一样的
    - Our main finding is that disks with SF clumps at z ~ 0 make a similar fraction (~15%) of star-forming galaxies as at z ~ 2. 最大的贡献在z~1
    - Among green valley and quiescent galaxies, the pure spheroid fraction drops since z ~ 1, whereas spheroids with disks (S0-like) become dominant.

- [The rocky road to quiescence: compaction and quenching of quasar host galaxies at z~2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01277)
    - 7个 1.5 < z < 2.8的透镜放大的QSO host星系:We find that the quasar hosts in our sample can be distinguished into two types
        1. Clumpy SF, Re~2 kpc; 平均SFR密度与mm-selected dusty SF星系类似
        2. Passive or compact SB, Re~0.5 kpc; SFR面密度非常高
    - 第二类可能是处于compaction阶段的：For the one system where we probe the mass of the gas reservoir, we find a gas fraction of just 0.06±0.04 and a depletion timescale of 50±40 Myr, suggesting it is transitioning into quiescence.

- [The dynamical state of Abell 2399: a bullet-like cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01400)
    - We apply a Gaussian Mixture Model to the spectroscopic data from SDSS, WINGS, and Omega WINGS Surveys to identify substructures. 能重现两个主要的X-ray concentration.

- [A Spectroscopic Survey of Lyα Emitters at z≈3.1 over ∼1.2 Deg2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01500)
    - Subaru XMM-Deep Survey: Using spectroscopic observations on MMT Hectospec and Magellan M2FS, we obtained a sample of 166 LAEs at z≈3.1 over an effective area of ∼1.2 deg2
    - Significant overdense and underdense regions are detected in our sample, but the area coverage is wide enough to largely suppress the effect from such cosmic variance.
    - Lya LF: At the brightest end of the LF, there is a tentative detection of a density excess that is not well described by the Schechter function. Lya LF在2< z < 5演化不大
    - Composite光谱里探测到了NVI和CIV发射线，说明发射场很硬

- [The stellar halos of ETGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations: II. Accretion, merger history, and dark halo connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01823)
    - **Relevant, Important**
    - We use a sample of 1114 ETGs in the TNG100 simulation with stellar masses 10^10.3≤M∗/M⊙≤10^12, selected at z=0 within the range of g-r colour and lambda-ellipticity diagram populated by observed ETGs.
    - Low-mass ETGs have characteristic peaked rotation profiles and near-oblate shapes with rounder halos that are completely driven by the in-situ stars. At high fex major mergers decrease the in-situ peak in rotation velocity, flatten the V∗/σ∗(R) profiles, and increase the triaxiality of the stellar halos.
    - Kinematic transition radii do not trace the transition between in-situ and ex-situ dominated regions, but for systems with M∗>10^10.6M⊙ the local rotational support and triaxiality of the stellar halos is anti-correlated with the local ex-situ fraction fex(R) at fixed M∗
    - Merger events dynamically couple stars and dark matter: in high mass ETGs and at large radii where fex≳0.5, both components tend to have similar intrinsic shapes and rotational support, and nearly aligned principal axes and spin directions.

- [HMcode-2020: Improved modelling of non-linear cosmological power spectra with baryonic feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01858)
    - 升级HMcode，提供更精确的non-linear matter power spectrum预测
    - Major improvements include modelling of BAO damping in the power spectrum and an updated treatment of massive neutrinos.
    - 能考虑Baryonic feedback: We also present a simple halo model that can be used to model the impact of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum.

- [Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the projected cross-correlation function between the eBOSS DR16 quasars and photometric galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02308)
    - When cross-correlating the photometric galaxies with quasars in 0.6≤z≤1.2, the cross-correlation function can provide better constraints on the comoving angular distance, DM (6\% precision) compared to the constraint on the spherically-averaged distance DV (9\% precision) obtained from the auto-correlation.

- [A comparative analysis of denoising algorithms for extragalactic imaging surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01846)
    - **Useful**
    - The methods under analysis are Perona-Malik filtering, Bilateral filter, Total Variation denoising, Structure-texture image decomposition, Non-local means, Wavelets, and Block-matching.
    - We analyze in terms of completeness and purity the catalogs extracted after applying denoising algorithms on a simulated Euclid Wide Survey VIS image, on real H160 (HST) and K-band (HAWK-I) observations of the CANDELS GOODS-South field.
    - 和PSF filtering比的优势：The advantage of denoising techniques with respect to PSF filtering increases at increasing depth. Moreover, these techniques better preserve the shape of the detected objects with respect to PSF smoothing.

- [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: the XMM-Newton X-ray source catalog and multi-band counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02193)
    - 932 of the XMM-RM sources are covered by SDSS spectroscopic observations. 89% of them are classified as AGN, and 71% of these AGN are in the SDSS-RM quasar catalog. Among the SDSS-RM quasars, 80% are detectable at the depth of the XMM observations.

- [Molecular Gas Properties on Cloud Scales Across the Local Star-forming Galaxy Population](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01842)
    - **Interesting**
    - PHANGS-ALMA CO (2-1) survey: Consistent with previous studies, we observe a wide range of molecular gas surface densities (3.4 dex), velocity dispersions (1.7 dex), and turbulent pressures (6.5 dex) across the galaxies in our sample.
    - The inferred virial parameters suggest that the kinetic energy of the molecular gas typically exceeds its self-gravitational binding energy at ∼100 pc scales by a modest factor (1.3 on average).

- [Mapping the Escape Fraction of Ionizing Photons Using Resolved Stars: A Much Higher Escape Fraction for NGC 4214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01844)
    - Local analog of high-z SB; 通过forward model分解开的恒星的SED来估计产生的电离光子数量
    - We constrain the local escape fraction by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by stars to the number that are either absorbed by dust or consumed by ionizing the surrounding neutral hydrogen in individual star-forming regions.
    - 光子逃逸率空间变化很大，0-40%；平均也很高，在25%左右
    - If we assume the NGC 4214 has no internal dust, like many high-redshift galaxies, we find an escape fraction of 59% (an upper-limit for NGC 4214)

- [Kinematic signatures of nuclear discs and bar-driven secular evolution in nearby galaxies of the MUSE TIMER project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01852)
    - We confirm theoretical predictions of the effects of bars on stellar kinematics, and identify box/peanuts through kinematic signatures in mildly and moderately inclined galaxies, finding a lower limit to the fraction of massive barred galaxies with box/peanuts at ~62%
    - We establish the presence of nuclear discs in 19 galaxies and show that their kinematics are characterised by near-circular orbits with low pressure support, and are consistent with the bar-driven secular evolution picture for their formation.
    - Comparing our results with photometric studies, we find that state-of-the-art galaxy image decompositions are able to discern nuclear discs from classical bulges.

- [The inside-out formation of nuclear discs and the absence of old central spheroids in barred galaxies of the TIMER survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01856)
    - MUSE观测：Nuclear ring是nuclear disc的边缘，两者是同一个结构
    - Nuclear discs are younger, more metal-rich, and show lower [α/Fe] enhancements, as compared to their immediate surroundings
    - Nuclear discs exhibit well-defined radial gradients, with ages and metallicities decreasing, and [α/Fe] abundances increasing with radius out to the nuclear ring.
    - We argue that continuous (stellar) nuclear discs may form from a series of bar-built (initially gas-rich) nuclear rings that grow in radius, as the bar evolves.
    - We do not find evidence for the presence of large, dispersion-dominated components in the centres of these galaxies. This could be a result of quiet merger histories, despite the large galaxy masses, or perhaps high angular momentum and strong feedback processes preventing the formation of these kinematically hot components.

- [Gas-phase Metallicity as a Diagnostic of the Drivers of Star-formation on Different Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01935)
    - We first predict the correlation between SFR, cold gas mass and Z in the gas-regulator frame that the instantaneous SFR is regulated by the interplay between inflow, outflow and star formation.
    - The mean SFR is determined by mean inflow rate and mass-loading factor λ, while the mean Z is determined by the metallicity of inflow gas Z0 and the effective yield (yeff≡y/(1+λ)).
    - The SFR and Z relative to their mean values, denoted as ΔSFR and ΔZ, are found to be negatively (or positively) correlated when driving the gas-regulator with time-varying inflow rate (or SFE).
    - We find that ΔsSFR and ΔZ are found to be, negatively correlated at galactic or sub-galactic scale across galaxy population, and positively correlated at ∼100 pc scale within galaxies.

    - The compact starburst puts most of massive SFGs on the mass--size relation for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z~2 within 300 Myr if the current star formation activity and its spatial distribution are maintained.
    - We also find that within 300 Myr, ~38% of massive SFGs can reach the central mass of M1kpc=1010.5 M⊙, which is around the boundary between massive SFGs and QGs.

    - Such a behavior can be interpreted as the result of long-term dynamical evolution of the systems driven by mass-segregation and mass-loss processes 但似乎需要老得多的年龄才能解释

- [MeerKAT's discovery of a radio relic in the bimodal merging cluster A2384](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02724)
    - A2384 is a nearby (z = 0.092), low mass, complex bimodal, merging galaxy cluster that displays a dense X-ray filament (∼ 700 kpc in length)
    - By using the MeerKAT observation of A2384, we estimate that the physical size of the radio relic is 824 × 264 kpc2 and that it is a steep spectrum source.
    - This radio relic could be the result of shock wave propagation during the passage of the low-mass A2384(S) cluster through the massive A2384(N) cluster, creating a trail appearing as a hot X-ray filament.
    - This newly detected radio relic is elongated and perpendicular to the merger axis, as seen in other relic clusters.

    - We find no evidence for significant evolution in M⋆, with the intrinsic value consistent with log10(M⋆/M⊙)=10.55±0.1 over the full redshift range: 0.25 < z < 3.75
    - We find that the star-forming GSMF can be adequately described by a single Schechter function over the full redshift range, and has not evolved significantly since z≃2.5. In contrast, both the normalization and functional form of the passive GSMF evolves dramatically with redshift, switching from a single to a double Schechter function at z≤1.5

- [Fewer Mocks and Less Noise: Reducing the Dimensionality of Cosmological Observables with Subspace Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03311)
    - **Interesting**
    - We present a formalism to compress arbitrary observables into a small number of bins by projecting into a subspace that minimizes the log-likelihood error. The lower dimensionality leads to a dramatic reduction in covariance matrix noise
    - Given a theory model, a set of priors, and a simple model of the covariance, our method works by using singular value decompositions to construct a basis for the observable that is close to Euclidean; by restricting to the first few basis vectors, we can capture almost all the signal-to-noise in a lower-dimensional subspace.
    - Unlike conventional approaches, the method can be tailored for specific analyses and captures non-linearities that are not present in the Fisher matrix, ensuring that the full likelihood can be reproduced.

We also present, for the first time, the application of a machine learning-based inference machinery to obtain dynamical masses of around 900 galaxy clusters found in the SDSS Legacy Survey and demonstrate that the inferred masses reproduce the cluster mass function, as predicted by Planck ΛCDM cosmology, down to 10^14.1h−1M

    - The model assumes optically thick continuous outflows like stellar winds, and one key question is how the wind-launched radius is connected to physical processes in TDEs. As one possibility, through a comparison between the escape velocities estimated from their black-hole masses and the wind velocities estimated from observed line widths, we propose that the outflow is launched from the self-interaction radius (RSI) where the stellar debris stretched by the tidal force intersects

- [EDGE: A new approach to suppressing numerical diffusion in adaptive mesh simulations of galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03313)
    - **Interesting**
    - The target galaxy has a maximum circular velocity of 21 km/s but evolves in a region which is moving at up to 90 km/s relative to the hydrodynamic grid. In the absence of any mitigation, diffusion softens the filaments feeding our galaxy. As a result, gas is unphysically held in the circumgalactic medium around the galaxy for 320 Myr, delaying the onset of star formation until cooling and collapse eventually triggers an initial starburst at z=9.
    - Using genetic modification, we produce 'velocity-zeroed' initial conditions in which the grid-relative streaming is strongly suppressed 让高红移的SF更连续，平滑，但最终恒星质量差不多

- [The large-scale environment of FR 0 radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03330)
    - By using various estimators we find that FR0s live in regions of higher than the average galaxies density and a factor two lower density, on average, with respect to FRI radio galaxies. This latter difference is driven by the large fraction (63%) of FR0s located in groups formed by less than 15 galaxies, an environment which FRIs rarely (17%) inhabit.

    - Our SMGs lie mostly on or just above the main sequence, displaying a decrease in their gas depletion timescales tdep=Mgas/SFR with redshift in the range z∼1-5 and a median of 200±50Myr at z∼2.8.
    - Finally we demonstrate that the Mbaryon-σ distribution of our SMGs is consistent with that followed by early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, providing strong support to the suggestion that SMGs are progenitors of massive local spheroidal galaxies.

    - We estimate that, in the Solar Neighbourhood, ∼1/2 (∼1/3) of the old thin (thick) disc stars can be classified as migrators.
    - Our results suggest that thin/thick discs are affected differently by radial migration inasmuch as they have different eccentricity distributions, regardless of vertical scale heights
