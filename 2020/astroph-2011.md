- [𝚍𝚎𝚎𝚙𝟸𝟷: a Deep Learning Method for 21cm Foreground Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15843)
    - We demonstrate that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a UNet architecture and three-dimensional convolutions, trained on simulated observations, can effectively separate frequency and spatial patterns of the cosmic neutral hydrogen (HI) signal from foregrounds in the presence of noise.
    - Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing 21cm intensity maps, as opposed to derived summary statistics, for upcoming radio experiments, as long as the simulated foreground model is sufficiently realistic.

- [Gaussian Process Foreground Subtraction and Power Spectrum Estimation for 21 cm Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15892)
    - Recent works have claimed that Gaussian process regression (GPR) can robustly perform this separation, particularly at low Fourier k wavenumbers where the signal reaches its peak signal-to-noise ratio
    - We revisit this topic by casting GPR foreground subtraction (GPR-FS) into the quadratic estimator formalism, thereby putting its statistical properties on stronger theoretical footing. We find that GPR-FS can distort the window functions at these low k modes, which, without proper decorrelation, make it difficult to probe the EoR power spectrum.

- [Data Compression and Covariance Matrix Inspection: Cosmic Shear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15986)
    - We investigate various compression mechanisms capable of vastly reducing the size of the covariance matrix in the context of cosmic shear statistics.
    - Massively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) - only MOPED was able to replicate the original constraints in the 16-parameter space.
    - We apply a tolerance test to the elements of the compressed covariance matrix obtained with MOPED and confirm that the IA parameter A_IA is the most susceptible to inaccuracies in the covariance matrix.

- [Improving models of the cosmic infrared background using CMB lensing mass maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16405)
    - In measurements of the millimeter sky at frequencies higher than ∼300 GHz, the CIB and thermal emission from Galactic dust dominate. A limited understanding of the CIB contribution at lower frequencies on the other hand can hinder efforts to measure the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich spectrum on small scales as well as new physics that affects the damping tail of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). 
    - We show how significant improvements (20-100%) can be obtained on parameters of star formation models by cross-correlating the CIB (as measured from existing {\it Planck} maps or upcoming CCAT-prime maps) with upcoming mass maps inferred from gravitational lensing of the CMB.

- [The Evolution of Gas-Phase Metallicity and Resolved Abundances in Star-forming Galaxies at z≈0.6−1.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15847)
    - We define the stellar mass-metallicity relation at z≈0.6−1.0 and z≈1.2−1.8 and analyse the correlation between the scatter in the relation and fundamental galaxy properties
    - We find that for a given stellar mass, more highly star-forming, larger and irregular galaxies have lower gas-phase metallicities, which may be attributable to their lower surface mass densities and the higher gas fractions of irregular systems
    - A median, beam smearing-corrected, metallicity gradient of ΔZ/ΔR=0.002±0.004 dex kpc−1, indicating on average there is no significant dependence on radius.

- [BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey-XX: Molecular Gas in Nearby Hard X-ray Selected AGN Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15849)
    - We find that AGN in massive galaxies tend to have more molecular gas, and higher gas fractions, than inactive galaxies matched in stellar mass. 
    - When matched in star formation, we find AGN galaxies show no difference from inactive galaxies with no evidence of AGN feedback affecting the molecular gas.
    - The likelihood of a given galaxy hosting an AGN (L_bol>10^44 erg/s) increases by ~10-100 between a molecular gas mass of 10^8.7 Msun and 10^10.2 Msun. 
    - Higher Eddington ratio AGN galaxies tend to have higher molecular gas masses and gas fractions.

- [Connecting cosmological accretion to strong Lyman-alpha absorbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15857)
    - Performing simplified radiative transfer, we compute how the accreting gas turns increasingly neutral as it self-shields from the ionising background, and obtain the column density, NHI, as a function of impact parameter.
    - 关注点是柱密度分布函数,CDDF: The analytical expression elucidates (1) why halos over a large range in mass contribute about equally to the CDDF as well as (2) why the CDDF evolves so little with redshift in the range z=2→5.
    - CDDF的积分可以给出中性气体质量密度：ΩHI(z)  is nearly constant even though the accretion rate onto halos evolves. We show that this occurs because the fraction of time that the inflowing gas is neutral depends on the dynamical time of the halo, which is inversely proportional to the accretion rate.
    - 绝大多数的LLS和DLA都是正在吸积的气体：Most Lyman-limit system and damped Lyman-alpha absorbers are associated with the cosmological accretion of gas onto halos. 

- [Galactic merger implications for eccentric nuclear disks: a mechanism for disk alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15957)
    - 以M31中的nuclear disk为背景，看星系并合后，可能的second SMBH对盘的影响：We perform N-body simulations to study the disk under a range of different possible SMBH initial conditions. A second SMBH in the disk always disrupts it, but more distant SMBHs can shut off differential precession and stabilize the disk. This results in a more aligned disk, nearly uniform eccentricity profile, and suppression of tidal disruption events compared to the isolated disk.

- [The stellar mass function and evolution of the density profile of galaxy clusters from the Hydrangea simulations at 0<z<1.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16195)
    - **Relevant**
    - 24 massive galaxy clusters (>10^14M⊙ at z=0); 模拟中在z>1处有过多的<10^10 Msun星系
    - The NFW concentrations of cluster galaxies increase with redshift, in contrast to the decreasing dark matter halo concentrations
    - Quantitatively, we however find a discrepancy in that the simulations predict higher stellar concentrations than observed at lower redshifts (z<0.3), by a factor of ≈2.

- [Turbulent Gas in Lensed Planck-selected Starbursts at redshifts 1-3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16231)
    - 关于高红移富气体星暴星系中ISM的激发状态：We analyze 162 CO rotational transitions (ranging from Jupper = 1 - 12) and 37 atomic carbon fine-structure lines ([CI]) in order to characterize the physical conditions of the gas in sample of LPs.
    - 用两个模型同时拟合CO+CI+连续谱：第一个模型是个双成分气体模型; The first model represents a two component gas density, while the second assumes a turbulence driven log-normal gas density distribution.
    - 模型描述了这些星系中湍动气体的性质：well-characterized by a high turbulent velocity dispersion (<ΔVturb>∼100 \kms) and gas kinetic temperature to dust temperature ratios <Tkin/Td>∼2.5, sustained on scales larger than a few kpc.

- [The effects of star formation history in the SFR-M relation of HII galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16296)
    - 看对HII星系，星暴矮星系等星系进行SED拟合时，假定不同SFH模型的影响
    - We modeled and fitted the SEDs with the code CIGALE adopting different descriptions of SFH. By adding information from different independent studies we find that HII galaxies are best described by episodic SFHs including an old (10 Gyr), an intermediate age (100-1000 Myr) and a recent population with ages < 10 Myr.
    - 在一定时标内平均的SFR上，矮星系也在M*-SFR的主序上；只有在使用当前SFR时才常位于这个关系的上方

- [Quantifying the impact of baryon-CDM perturbations on halo clustering and baryon fraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01037)
    - Baryons and cold dark matter (CDM) did not comove prior to recombination. This leads to differences in the local baryon and CDM densities, the so-called baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations δbc. 通常在LSS分析中被忽略
    - We further measure the cross-power spectrum between the halo field and δbc over a wide range of mass. This cross-correlation is nonzero and negative which shows that halo formation is impacted by δbc
    - This effect can be degenerate with the one of massive neutrinos for surveys like DESI.

    - 和中微子探测器联动的早期预警设备; 包括了大亚湾的中微子实验

- [Radio Monitoring of the Tidal Disruption Event Swift J164449.3+573451. IV. Continued Fading and Non-Relativistic Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00074)
    - 9.4年的VLA和Chandra监测；We find that the X-ray emission has faded below detectable levels；while the radio emission continues to be detected and steadily fade.
    - Both are consistent with forward shock emission from a non-relativistic outflow, although we find that the radio spectral energy distribution is better fit at these late times with an electron power law index of p≈3 (as opposed to p≈2.5 at earlier times).
    - The energy scale of the blastwave is ≈1052 erg.

- [The scaling relations and clustering properties of central and satellite galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00014)
    - **Relevant**
    - While central and satellite galaxies display similar stellar mass - size relations, their halo mass - size relations differ significantly.
    - More massive haloes tend to host larger central galaxies. However, the size of satellite galaxies depends only slightly on halo virial mass.
    - We show that these results are compatible with a remarkably simple model in which the size of central and satellite galaxies scales as the cubic root of their host halo mass, with the normalization for satellites being ∼30 % smaller than that for central galaxies which can be attributed to tidal stripping.

- [A disk-dominated and clumpy circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way seen in X-ray emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00126)
    - **Interesting**
    - 基于HaloSat Cubesat的巡天：we report a survey of the southern Galactic sky with a soft X-ray spectrometer optimized to study diffuse soft X-ray emission. The X-ray emission is best fit with a disc-like model based on the radial profile of the surface density of molecular hydrogen, a tracer of star formation, suggesting that the X-ray emission is predominantly from hot plasma produced via stellar feedback.
    - Strong variations in the X-ray emission on angular scales of ∼10∘ indicate that the CGM is clumpy.

- [A proto-pseudobulge in ESO 320-G030 fed by a massive molecular inflow driven by a nuclear bar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00347)
    - ALMA+Herschel H2O观测：Radiative transfer models indicate that 3 nuclear components are required to account for the H2O and continuum data. An envelope, a nuclear disk, and an extremely compact, warm, buried core component.
    - The nucleus is fed by a molecular inflow observed in CO 2-1 with ALMA, which is associated with the nuclear bar.
    - At lower r, the inflow is best probed by the far-infrared OH ground-state doublets, with an estimated inflow rate of ~30 Msun yr^{-1}. The short timescale of ~20 Myr for nuclear gas replenishment indicates quick secular evolution, and indicates that we are witnessing an intermediate stage (<100 Myr) proto-pseudobulge fed by a massive inflow that is driven by a strong nuclear bar.

- [A Method to Extract Spatially Resolved Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission from Spitzer Spectra: Application to M51](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00405)
    - **Interesting**
    - We present a new approach of analyzing the spatial elements of the spectral datacube that simultaneously maximizes spatial resolution and spatial coverage, while yielding reliable measurements of the total, integrated 5−20μm PAH emission
    - We find that in M51 the PAH emission correlates tightly with the extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet, near-ultraviolet, and Hα emission, from scales∼0.4 kpc close to the nucleus to 6 kpc out in the disk of the galaxy, indicating that PAH serves as an excellent tracer of SFR over a wide range of galactic environments.
    - The spiral arms and the central star-forming region of the galaxy emit stronger 7.7 and 8.6 μm PAH features than the inter-arm regions.

- [A kpc-scale resolved study of unobscured and obscured star-formation activity in normal galaxies at z = 1.5 and 2.2 from ALMA and HiZELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00686)
    - ALMA连续谱观测：Four galaxies in our sample are detected at high significance by ALMA at a resolution of 0.25'' at rest-frame 355 μm.
    - We find that ALMA detection rates are higher for more massive galaxies (M∗>10^10.5 M⊙) and higher [Nii]/Hα ratios
    - The dust extends out to a radius of 8 kpc, with a smooth structure, even for those galaxies presenting clumpy Hα morphologies.

- [UV and NIR size of the HI selected low surface brightness galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00688)
    - **Relevant**
    - We select a sample of 381 HI bright LSBGs with both Far Ultraviolet (FUV) and Near Infrared (NIR) observation to investigate the star formation rate (SFR): most of the HI selected LSBGs have extended star formation structure.
    - The stellar mass distribution of LSBGs may have a similar structure as the disk galaxies at the same stellar mass bins, while the star-forming activity of LSBGs happens at a larger radius than the high surface density galaxies, which may help to select the LSBG sample from the wide-field deep u band image survey.
    - HI radius比UV radius大3倍左右

- [A population of galaxy-scale jets discovered using LOFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01015)
    - **Interesting**
    - LoTSS研究低光度射电噪AGN的feedback：report on our discovery of a population of 195 radio galaxies and total radio emission no larger than 80 kpc. 
    - 大部分host都是椭圆星系，但也有~9%是旋涡星系：Two of the spiral-hosted GSJ are highly unusual with low radio luminosities and FRII-like morphology
    - 大都是年轻的jet: The host properties of our GSJ show that they are ordinary AGN observed at a stage in their life shortly after the radio emission has expanded beyond the central regions of the host.
    - 能量可以影响星系整体的ISM性质：we find that about half of our GSJ have internal radio lobe energy within an order of magnitude of the ISM energy so that, even ignoring any possible shocks, GSJ are energetically capable of affecting the evolution of the host.

- [Discovery of a new extreme changing-state quasar with 4 mag variation, SDSS J125809.31+351943.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01127)
    - SDSS J125809.31+351943.0 (J1258), which brightened in optical for 4 mag from 1983 to 2015, which is one of the largest quasar brightening events so far.
    - The results show that the continuum flux and the BEL flux decreased to about 50 % of its peak. This indicates that J1258 is causing two changing-states for the BEL flux and continuum flux.
    - We argue that J1258's variability, especially its brightening event, can be explained by the propagation of the heating front and the accretion disk state transitions based on the timescale and Eddington ratio variations.
