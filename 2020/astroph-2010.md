- [Can galaxy evolution mimic cosmic reionization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00023)
    - LAE在z>6的下降是否是再电离的影响。其中一个重要假设是星系本身在这阶段演化不大
    - 如果星系内的HI气体随红移增加，或者外流强度随红移下降，都可以模仿出这种效果；但可以通过Lya线的特征来区分
    - Using the CANDELSz7 survey measurements which indicate slightly broader lines at z∼6, we can rule out the scenario of a mere increase in the galactic column density towards higher z. We also show that a decrease in outflow velocity is not ruled out by existing data but leads to more prominent blue peaks at z>6.

- [Line confusion in spectroscopic surveys and its possible effects: Shifts in Baryon Acoustic Oscillations position](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00047)
    - Misidentifying Hβ emitter as [O III] emitter will cause a shift in the inferred radial position of the galaxy by approximately 90 Mpc/h. This length scale is similar to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale and could shift and broaden the BAO peak, possibly introduce errors in determining the BAO peak position.

- [Tightening weak lensing constraints on the ellipticity of galaxy-scale dark matter haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00311)
    - **Relevant**
    - we combine data from five surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS) in order to tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for photometrically selected lens sample
    - fh , the average ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity of the light distribution, finding fh=0.303+0.080−0.079 for red lenses and fh=0.217+0.160−0.159 for blue lenses
    - Our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for the studied red galaxy samples of ⟨|ϵh|⟩=0.174±0.046, where |ϵh|=(1−q)/(1+q) relates to the ratio q=b/a of the minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution.

- [Galaxy clustering in the Legacy Survey and its imprint on the CMB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00466)
    - Cross-correlation of the tomographic galaxy maps with Planck maps of temperature and lensing convergence probe the growth of structure since z=0.8
    - Within ΛCDM, our low amplitude for the lensing cross-correlation requires a reduction either in fluctuation normalization or in matter density compared to the Planck results, so that Ω0.78mσ8=0.297±0.009.

- [A significant excess in major merger rate for AGNs with the highest Eddington ratios at z<0.2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00022)
    - Using ESO VLT/FORS2 B-, V- and color images, we examine the morphologies of 17 galaxies hosting AGNs with Eddington ratios >0.3, and 25 mass- and redshift-matched control galaxies.
    - With a best estimate of 0.41 ± 0.12 for the AGN host galaxies and 0.08 ± 0.06 for the inactive galaxies our results imply that our AGN host galaxies have a significantly higher merger rate
    - We conclude that although major mergers are an essential mechanism to trigger local high Eddington ratio AGNs at z<0.2, the origin of >=50% of this specific AGN subpopulation still remains unclear.

- [A new high-precision strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00027)
    - MUSE观测：We spectroscopically identify 182 multiple images from 48 background sources at 0.9< z<6.2, and 171 cluster member galaxies.
    - 能更好的给出SF clumps的位置：By defining a new metric, which is sensitive to the gradients of the deflection field, we show that we can accurately reproduce the positions of these star-forming knots despite their vicinity to the model critical lines.
    - The high signal-to-noise spectra of the MDLF enables the measurement of the internal velocity dispersion of 64 cluster galaxies, down to m(F160W)=22. This allows us to independently estimate the contribution of the subhalo mass component of the lens model from the measured Faber-Jackson scaling relation

- [A novel black-hole mass scaling relation based on Coronal lines and supported by accretion predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00075)
    - 用发射线比： [Si VI] 1.963 micron/Brγbroad 建立黑洞质量的标度关系; 和黑洞质量有反相关
    - we believe that a key parameter driving this anti-correlation is the effective temperature of the accretion disc, this being effectively sampled by the coronal line gas. 吸积盘温度与黑洞质量的-1/4次方成比例

- [The Faint End of the Quasar Luminosity Function at z∼5 from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00481)
    - HSC-Wide中用Lyman-break挑选的z~5 QSO：we derived the quasar luminosity function at z∼5 covering a wide luminosity range of −28.76<M1450<−22.32 mag.
    - The inferred number density of low-luminosity quasars is lower, and the derived faint-end slope, −1.22+0.03−0.10, is flatter than those of previous studies at z∼5.

- [Self-calibration of weak lensing systematic effects using combined two- and three-point statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00614)
    - We investigate the prospects for using the weak lensing bispectrum alongside the power spectrum to control systematic uncertainties in a Euclid-like survey.
    - Varying all three systematics simultaneously, a joint power spectrum and bispectrum analysis reduces the area of credible regions for the cosmological parameters Ωm and σ8 by a factor of 90
    - We also demonstrate that including the bispectrum self-calibrates all three systematic effects to the stringent levels required by the forthcoming generation of weak lensing surveys, thereby reducing the need for external calibration data.

- [The CAMELS project: Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00619)
    - CAMELS is a suite of 4,233 cosmological simulations of (25 h−1Mpc)3 volume each: 2,184 state-of-the-art (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations run with the AREPO and GIZMO codes 重子物理采用了TNG和SIMBA的模型
    - We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but significantly different halo baryon fractions and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum.
    - 对探索ML在宇宙学里的应用很有帮助

- [Pix2Prof: fast extraction of sequential information from galaxy imagery via deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00622)
    - **Relevant, Useful**
    - "Pix2Prof", a deep learning model that eliminates manual steps in the measurement of galaxy surface brightness (SB) profiles.
    - 把从星系图像中获取profile的过程与给图片加caption等同起来，在SDSS图像上测试，效率很高

- [Wide-field ultra-narrow-bandpass imaging with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00686)
    - Dragonfly Filter-Tilter, a device which places ultra-narrow bandpass interference filters (Δλ≈1 nm) in front of each of the lenses that make up the array.
    - The filters are at the entrance pupil of the optical system, rather than in a converging beam, so their performance is not degraded by a converging light cone.
    - By tilting the filters, the central wavelength of the transmission curve can be tuned over a range of 7 nm, corresponding to a physical distance range of about 20 Mpc of extragalactic targets.

- [The Lyman Continuum Escape Survey: Connecting Time-Dependent [OIII] and [OII] Line Emission with Lyman Continuum Escape Fraction in Simulations of Galaxy Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00592)
    - 模拟研究：we find that the largest fesc values occur at elevated O32∼3−10 and that the combination of high fesc and low O32 is extremely rare. 但是O32和fesc之间并不一定有因果联系,large O32 does not necessarily imply efficient Lyman continuum escape.
    - Large O32 values fluctuate on short (∼1 Myr) timescales during the Wolf-Rayet-powered phase after the formation of star clusters, while channels of low absorption are established over tens of megayears by collections of supernovae.

- [Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project. XII. Broad-Line Region Modeling of NGC 5548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00594)
    - We find an extended disk-like Hβ BLR with a mixture of near-circular and outflowing gas trajectories, while the C IV and Lyα BLRs are much less extended and resemble shell-like structures.
    - 三条线给出的SMBH质量是一致的；且V  band is a suitable proxy for the ionizing continuum when exploring the BLR structure and kinematics.

- [HOLISMOKES -- IV. Efficient Mass Modeling of Strong Lenses through Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00602)
    - We train a CNN on images of galaxy-scale lenses to predict the parameters of the SIE mass model (x,y,ex,ey, and θE).
    - Our CNN is able to predict the SIE parameters in fractions of a second on a single CPU and with the output we can predict the image positions and time delays in an automated way, such that we are able to process efficiently the huge amount of expected lens detections in the near future.

- [Biases and Cosmic Variance in Molecular Gas Abundance Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00609)
    - 目前的mm-波高红移CO巡天的视场都很小：fields ≲10 arcmin2 alter the recovered shape of the luminosity function, causing underestimates of the number of bright objects. Our models suggest that current surveys are sensitive enough to detect sources responsible for approximately half of the cosmic molecular gas density at high redshift.
    - As a result, the field size needed to detect redshift evolution in the molecular gas at high confidence may be more than an order of magnitude larger than what current surveys

- [Tracing Dark Matter Halos with Satellite Kinematics and Central Stellar Velocity Dispersion of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00693)
    - **Relevant**
    - SDSS中挑选的isolated和satellite星系，分成red和blue，看速度弥散度的标度关系：The central stellar velocity dispersions of the primary galaxies are proportional to the luminosities and stellar masses of the same galaxies. Stacking the sample based on the central velocity dispersion of the primary galaxies, we derive velocity dispersions of their satellite galaxies, which trace dark matter halo mass of the primary galaxies.
    - 星系周围的卫星星系的运动学与中心星系的速度弥散度关系很好: his tight relation suggests that the central stellar velocity dispersion of galaxies is indeed an efficient and robust tracer for dark matter halo mass.

- [RAiSERed: radio continuum redshifts for lobed AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00790)
    - 未来射电巡天发现的大部分射电星系都没有红移，本文提出一种只需要射电数据测红移的方法：our algorithm uses the lobe flux density, angular size and width, and spectral shape to derive probability density functions for the most likely source redshift based on the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments (RAiSE) dynamical model.
    - We find that upper bounds on the angular size, as expected for unresolved sources, are sufficient to yield accurate redshift measurements at z > 2.

- [Deep Learning for Line Intensity Mapping Observations: Information Extraction from Noisy Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00809)
    - 以SPHEREx为目标进行的模型训练：We develop conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) that extract designated signals and information from noisy maps.
    - The overall reconstruction performance depends on the pixel size and on the survey volume assumed for the training data.

- [Spectral energy distributions of dust and PAHs based on the evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00922)
    - Based on a one-zone evolution model of grain size distribution in a galaxy, we calculate the evolution of infrared spectral energy distribution (SED), considering silicate, carbonaceous dust, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
    - 模型的主要参数是星际辐射场强度，恒星形成时标，以及ISM中致密气体的比例
    - 星系演化早期的尘埃颗粒尺寸较大，SED中的MIR成分较弱；At an intermediate stage (t∼1 Gyr for τSF=5 Gyr), the MIR emission grows rapidly because the abundance of small grains increases drastically by the accretion of gas-phase metals.
    - We find that small ηdense (i.e. the ISM dominated by the diffuse phase) is favoured to reproduce the 8 μm intensity dominated by PAHs both for the nearby and the z∼2 samples.

- [Mass-Velocity Dispersion Relation in HIFLUGCS Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00992)
    - **Relevant**
    - HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample (HIFLUGCS): measure the spatially resolved, line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of these clusters, which we find to be mostly flat at large radii, reminiscent of the rotation curves of galaxies.
    - Discover a tight empirical relation between the baryonic mass Mbar and the flat velocity dispersion σ of the member galaxies, i.e. MVDR
    - The residuals of the MVDR are uncorrelated with other cluster properties like temperature, cluster radius, baryonic mass surface density, and redshift.

### Oct 5

- [Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Cosmological Constraints from Cluster Abundances, Weak Lensing, and Galaxy Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01138)
    - **Important**
    - 联合宇宙学限制： From a joint analysis of cluster abundances, three cluster cross-correlations, and auto correlations of galaxy density, we obtain Ωm=0.305+0.055−0.038 and σ8=0.783+0.064−0.054.
    - We thus combine cluster abundances and all two-point correlations from three cosmic tracer fields and find improved constraints on cosmological parameters as well as on the cluster observable--mass scaling relation.

- [On the "Lensing is Low" of BOSS Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01143)
    - **Relevant**
    - Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modelling of the SMF, clustering, and lensing of BOSS LOWZ and CMASS samples at Planck cosmology. 对central和satellite星系用不同方式处理
    - The best-fitting HOD successfully describes all three observables without over-predicting the small-scale lensing signal. This indicates that the model places BOSS galaxies into dark matter halos of the correct halo masses, thereby eliminating the discrepancy in the one-halo regime where the signal-to-noise of lensing is the highest. 1Mpc/h以内的lensing is low可以被正确的模型解决
    - The observed lensing amplitude above 1 Mpc/h remains inconsistent with the prediction, which is however firmly anchored by the large-scale galaxy bias measured by clustering at Planck cosmology.

- [Determination of the Local Hubble Constant from Virgo Infall Using TRGB Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01364)
    - A new determination of H0 using velocities and Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distances to 33 galaxies located between the Local Group and the Virgo cluster. We obtain H0= 65.9 ± 3.5(stat) ± 2.4(sys) km s−1 Mpc−1

- [Statistical modelling of the cosmological dispersion measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01560)
    - 基于TNG300的：The free-electron power spectrum turns out to be consistent with the dark matter power spectrum at large scales, but it is strongly damped at small scales (≲1Mpc) owing to the stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback.
    - We have also obtained the probability distribution of source redshift for a given DM, which helps in identifying the host galaxies of FRBs from the measured DMs

- [IQ Collaboratory II: The Quiescent Fraction of Isolated, Low Mass Galaxies Across Simulations and Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01132)
    - **Interesting**
    - 比较EAGLE, TNG, SIMBA: All three simulations show a decrease in the number of quiescent, isolated galaxies in the mass range M∗=109−10 M⊙, in broad agreement with observations.
    - 但是，None of the simulations reproduce the observed absence of quiescent field galaxies below 10^9-10 Msun, 都高估了

- [The clustering of submillimeter galaxies detected with ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01133)
    - **Interesting**
    - 利用ALESS巡天测量SMG的clustering：We constrain upper limits for the median mass of halos hosting SMGs at 1< z<3, finding Mhalo ≤2.4×10^12M⊙ for SMGs with flux densities S870≥4.0mJy 比之前单镜观测得到的成团性要低很多
    - 说明之前对SMG的halo质量也过高估计了：We conclude that only the brightest (S870≳5−6mJy) SMGs would trace massive structures at z∼2 and only SMGs with S870≳6mJy may be connected to massive local elliptical galaxies, quasars at intermediate redshifts and high-redshift star-forming galaxies, whereas fainter SMGs are unlikely linked to these populations.

- [Dust Attenuation Curves at z ∼ 0.8 from LEGA-C: Precise Constraints on the Slope and 2175Å Bump Strength](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01147)
    - We find that the attenuation curves in the rest-frame 3000−4500A range are typically almost twice as steep as the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and Calzetti attenuation curves
    - The attenuation at 4500A and the slope strongly correlate with the galaxy inclination: face-on galaxies show less attenuation and steeper curves compared to edge-on galaxies 星系盘的指向对消光的影响最大
    - 在260/485个星系里看到了2175 bump，bump的强度似乎和星系性质关系不大；但bump确实多在低质量，正向星系里面出现

- [The dependence of the galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation on galaxy morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01186)
    - **Relevant**
    - SDSS:
        - At fixed halo mass in the mass range 10^11.7−10^12.9M⊙, the median stellar masses of SDSS disc galaxies are up to a factor of 1.4 higher than the median masses of their elliptical counterparts. 但这个结论与采用的恒星质量估计有关
        - For halo masses larger than 10^13M⊙, discs are less massive than ellipticals in same-mass haloes, regardless of whose stellar mass estimates we use.
    - EAGLE:
        - The EAGLE simulation predicts that discs are up to a factor of 1.5 more massive than elliptical galaxies residing in same-mass haloes less massive than 10^13M⊙ 这些质量不大，host盘星系的halo比同样质量host Elliptical的halo的assembly time要早
        - This suggests that the discs are more massive because they had more time for gas accretion and star formation.

- [Dust and gas in the central region of NGC 1316 (Fornax A) -- Its origin and nature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01606)
    - HST color map; MUSE NaD absorption and velocity measurements: The velocity field of the ionised gas (and thus of the dust) is characterised by small-scale turbulent movements that indicate short lifetimes. At the very centre, a bipolar velocity field of the ionised gas is observed, which we interpret as an outflow
    - Our findings are strongly suggestive of a dusty outflow. Nuclear outflows may be important dust-producing machines in galaxies.

- [ALMaQUEST -- IV. The ALMA-MaNGA QUEnching and STar formation (ALMaQUEST) Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01751)
    - ALMA观测46个sSFR分布很宽的MaNGA星系：the sSFR depends on both the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the molecular gas fraction (fH2), although the correlation with the latter is slightly weaker.
    - On kpc scales, the variations in both SFE and fH2 within individual galaxies can be as large as 1-2 dex thereby demonstrating that the availability of spatially-resolved observations is essential to understand the details of both star formation and quenching processes.

- [A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission. VESTIGE VIII. Bridging the cluster-ICM-galaxy evolution at small scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02202)
    - VESTIGE Hα, Herschel SPIRE far-infrared, and VIVA HI data: We measure FIR emission from tails of stripped dust following the ionised and atomic gas components in galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping
    - Along the stripped component, the dust distribution closely follows the HI and Hα emitting gas, all extending beyond the optical disc. 这些区域的Dust-to-gas mass ratios (DGRs)比星系盘上要低很多
    - We also find a negative trend in the DGR as a function of the metallicity that can be explained in terms of a dust component more centrally concentrated in more metal-rich systems.
    - Our results support an outside-in stripping scenario of the galaxy interstellar medium.

### Oct 6

- [Listening to the BOSS: the galaxy power spectrum take on spatial curvature and cosmic concordance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02230)
    - Planck似乎限制Omega_K < 0; 但BAO支持Omega_K = 0;
    - Using measurements of the full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum, P(k), from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR12 CMASS sample. By combining Planck data with FS measurements, we break the geometrical degeneracy and find ΩK=0.0023±0.0028.
    - However, as with BAO, the overall increase in the best-fit χ2 suggests a similar level of tension between Planck and P(k) under the assumption of a curved Universe.

- [Fast analytical random pair counts calculation for realistic survey geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02793)
    - Because pair counting scales as O(N2), where N is the number of points, the computational time to measure random pair counts cn be very expensive for large surveys.
    - We present an alternative approach for estimating those counts that does not rely on the use of a random catalogue. We derive an analytical expression for the anisotropic random-random pair counts that accounts for the galaxy radial distance distribution, survey geometry, and possible galaxy weights.

- [Overdensities of Submillimetre-Bright Sources around Candidate Protocluster Cores Selected from the South Pole Telescope Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02909)
    - We find a total of 98 sources above a threshold of 3.7 sigma in the observed area of 1300 square arcminutes, where the bright central cores resolve into multiple components.
    - The large overdensities of bright submm sources surrounding these fields suggest that they could be candidate protoclusters undergoing massive star-formation events.

- [How the Population III Initial Mass Function Governs the Properties of the First Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02212)
    - ENZO模拟：We find that a top-heavy Pop III IMF results in earlier star formation but dimmer galaxies than a more conventional Salpeter-type IMF because explosions of massive Pop III stars produce more turbulence that suppresses high-mass second-generation star formation

- [Dark-matter-deficient dwarf galaxies form via tidal stripping of dark matter in interactions with massive companions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02219)
    - NewHorizon模拟：sustained stripping of dark matter, in tidal interactions between a massive galaxy and a dwarf satellite, naturally produces dwarfs that are dark-matter deficient, even though their initial dark-matter fractions are normal.
    - The process of dark matter stripping is responsible for the large scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass relation in the dwarf regime. The degree of stripping is driven by the closeness of the orbit of the dwarf around its massive companion

- [Galaxies with kinematically distinct cores in Illustris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02222)
    - Illustris模拟里面KDC星系的分析：KDCs can be long-lived features, with their formation epochs roughly uniformly distributed in look-back times 0-11.4 Gyr, and they can survive even major or multiple subsequent mergers.
    - 没有单一的形成渠道，并合占60%，大质量星系中主要来自major merger
    - The mean mass-weighted stellar age inside the KDC radius is either about the same as the look-back time of the KDC formation or older.

- [Exemplary Merging Clusters: Weak-lensing and X-ray Analysis of the Double Radio Relic Merging Galaxy Clusters MACS 1752.0+4440 and ZWCL 1856.8+6616](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02226)
    - Our weak-lensing mass estimates show that each cluster is a major merger with approximately 1:1 mass ratio.
    - 尽管质量差别很大，但是WL和X-ray特征很相近
    - From the likeness of the X-ray morphologies and the remarkable symmetry of the radio relics, we propose that both systems underwent nearly head-on collisions.

- [Creating a galaxy lacking dark matter in a dark matter dominated universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02245)

- [An ALMA survey of the S2CLS UDS field: Optically invisible submillimetre galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02250)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    - We estimate that K>25.3 submillimetre galaxies represent 15+/-2 per cent of the total population brighter than S870=3.6mJy, with an expected surface density of ~450/deg^2 above S870>1mJy. 但只是Submm星系分布的tail；只是和K<25.3 mag的比，红移分布更高，尘埃消光更高; 消光高可能与其compact size有关
    - 可能成为高红移quiescent星系和LBG搜索的contamination
    - The concentrated, intense star-formation activity in these systems is likely to be associated with the formation of spheroids in compact galaxies at high redshifts, but as a result of their high obscuration these are completely missed in UV, optical and even near-infrared surveys.

- [Is there enough star formation in simulated protoclusters?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02259)
    - **Relevant**
    - 现代模拟和SAM中的proto-cluster中没有足够的SF，比观测低了一个量级
    - 认为和模拟分辨率有关：We show that a large part of the discrepancy can be attributed to a dependence of SFR on the numerical resolution of the simulations, with a roughly factor of 3 drop in SFR when the spatial resolution decreases by a factor of 4.
    - 可以用proto-cluster的模型校准来限制星系演化模型，确保z=0的大质量星系的模型是正确的

- [Probing the Warm-Hot Circumgalactic Medium with broad OVI and X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02312)
    - OVI吸收线中的窄线成分指示的是logT=5.5的较冷的成分，而宽OVI吸收指示的是占CGM大部分的warm-hot成分
    - About 800ks of XMM-Newton observations will detect the expected absorption lines of OVII and OVIII unequivocally. Future missions like XRISM, Arcus and Athena will revolutionize the CGM science.

- [Investigating the Effect of Galaxy Interactions on AGN Enhancement at 0.5<z<3.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02710)
    - COSMOS+CANDELS: While we see a slight increase in AGN fraction with decreasing projected separation, overall, we find no significant enhancement relative to the control sample at any separation.

- [Scaling relations and baryonic cycling in local star-forming galaxies: II. Gas content and star-formation efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02919)
    - A sample of 392 galaxies (dubbed MAGMA, Metallicity and Gas for Mass Assembly)
    - We find the metallicity (Z) dependence of alpha_CO to be shallower than previous estimates
    - Molecular gas mass MH2 is found to be strongly correlated with Mstar and star-formation rate (SFR), enabling predictions of MH2 good to within ∼0.2 dex.
    - If Mgas is considered to depend on MHI, together with Mstar and SFR, we obtain a relation that predicts Mgas to within ∼0.05 dex.
    - Dwarf galaxies tend to be overwhelmed by (HI) accretion, while for galaxies in the intermediate Mstar "gas-equilibrium" bin, star formation proceeds apace with gas availability. In the most massive "gas-poor, bimodality" galaxies, HI does not apparently participate in star formation, although it generally dominates in mass over H2

### Oct 7

- [Learning effective physical laws for generating cosmological hydrodynamics with Lagrangian Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02926)
    - 针对生成模拟方法在高维度空间的不足：we propose Lagrangian Deep Learning (LDL) for this purpose, applying it to learn outputs of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations -- The model uses layers of Lagrangian displacements of particles describing the observables to learn the effective physical laws.
    - The displacements are modeled as the gradient of an effective potential, which explicitly satisfies the translational and rotational invariance.
    - The computational cost of LDL is nearly four orders of magnitude lower than the full hydrodynamical simulations, yet it outperforms it at the same resolution.

- [A Self-Calibrating Halo-Based Group Finder: Application to SDSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02946)
    - **Useful, Important** https://www.galaxygroupfinder.net/catalogs
    - This algorithm introduces new freedom to assign halos to galaxies that is self-calibrated by comparing the catalog to complementary data. These include galaxy clustering data and measurements of the total satellite luminosity from deep imaging data.
    - The transition halo mass scale, where half of halos contain quiescent central galaxies, is at M_h~10^12.4 Msol/h, significantly higher than other constraints.
    - Quiescent central galaxies in low-mass halos are significantly more massive than star-forming centrals at the same halo mass, but this difference reverses above the transition halo mass.
    - We find that the scatter in logM* at fixed M_h is ~0.2 dex for massive halos, in agreement with previous estimates, but rises sharply at lower halo masses.

- [The eROSITA X-ray telescope on SRG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03477)
    - **Important**
    - By the end of 2023, eight complete scans of the celestial sphere will have been performed, each lasting six months

    - **Relevant, Important, Interesting**
    - C-EAGLE模拟：the stellar distribution (or intracluster light, ICL) also has a well-defined edge, which is directly related to the splashback radius of the halo.
    - We show that these caustics can also be seen in the projected density profiles, but care must be taken to account for the influence of substructures and other non-diffuse material, which can bias and/or weaken the signal of the steepest slope.
    - We show that the "stellar splashback" feature is located beyond current observational constraints on the ICL, but these large projected distances (>>1 Mpc) and low surface brightnesses (mu >> 32 mag/arcsec^2)

    - 实际观测中用视向速度cut可能会包含virial radii以外的气体：While the corotating Mg II gas generally extends beyond 0.5rvir, the Mg II gas outside of the virial radius contaminates the corotation signal and makes observers less likely to conclude that gas at large impact parameters (e.g., ≳0.25rvir) is corotating.

    - We use AGN specific accretion rate distribution functions determined as a function of stellar mass and redshift for star-forming and quiescent galaxies separately, combined with the latest galaxy-halo connection models, to determine the parent and sub-halo mass distribution function of AGN
    - 平均质量 2x10^12 Msun; 随AGN吸积率，光度，红移的变化不大
    - While the AGN satellite fraction rises with increasing parent halo mass, we find that the central galaxy is often not an AGN.
    - We further show that AGN clustering is most easily interpreted and understood in terms of the relative bias to galaxy samples, not from absolute bias measurements alone.

However, the mean mass ratios inferred from the WL masses of different projects vary by a large amount, with APEX-SZ showing a bias consistent with zero (1-b=1.02±0.12), LoCuSS and CCCP/MENeaCS showing a significant difference (1-b=0.76±0.09 and 1-b=0.77±0.10, respectively), and WtG pointing to the largest deviation (1-b=0.61±0.12)

    - **Relevant**
    - We analyzed a set of 260 synthetic clusters from the MUSIC simulation project, at redshifts 0≤z≤0.82.
    - The biases are of the order of 20%. We find that using the temperature instead of the pressure leads to a smaller bias, although the two values are compatible within 1σ.
    - We also present a study of the correlation between the mass bias and the dynamical state of the clusters. A clear correlation is shown between the relaxation state of the clusters and the bias factor.

- [Peculiar Velocity Estimation from Kinetic SZ Effect using Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03762)

    - The deep learning algorithm displays robustness in estimating peculiar velocities from kinetic SZ effect by an improvement in accuracy of about 17% compared to the analytical approach.

- [Why reducing the cosmic sound horizon can not fully resolve the Hubble tension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04158)
    - 解决H0 tension：Many of them introduce new physics, such as early dark energy, modifications of the standard model neutrino sector, extra radiation, primordial magnetic fields or varying fundamental constants, with the aim of reducing the sound horizon at recombination r⋆.
    - We demonstrate here that any model which {\it only} reduces r⋆ can never fully resolve the Hubble tension while remaining consistent with other cosmological datasets. We show explicitly that models which operate at lower matter density Ωmh2 run into tension with the observations of baryon acoustic oscillations, while models operating at higher Ωmh2 develop tension with galaxy weak lensing data.

- [Simulating cosmic structure formation with the GADGET-4 code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03567)

    - The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm.
    - Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows.
    - The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial conditions generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.

- [MMT Spectroscopy of Lyman-alpha at z≃7: Evidence for Accelerated Reionization Around Massive Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03566)
    - To better understand why Lyα is anonymously strong in a subset of massive z≃7−9 galaxies, we have initiated an MMT/Binospec survey targeting a larger sample (N=22) of similarly luminous (≃1−6 L∗UV) z≃7 galaxies
    - We confidently (>7σ) detect Lyα in 78% (7/9) of galaxies with strong [OIII]+Hβ emission (EW>800 A˚) as opposed to only 8% (1/12) of galaxies with more moderate (EW=200−800 A˚) [OIII]+Hβ.
    - We argue that the higher Lyα EWs of the strong [OIII]+Hβ population likely reflect enhanced ionizing photon production efficiency owing to their large sSFRs

- [The QuaStar Survey: Detecting Hidden Low-Velocity Gas in the Milky Way's Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03610)
    - **Interesting**
    - The content of the Milky Way's circumgalactic medium (CGM) is poorly constrained at |vLSR| ≲ 150 km s−1
    - The QuaStar Survey applies a spectral differencing technique using paired quasar-star sightlines to measure the obscured content of the Milky Way's CGM for the first time.
    - We present measurements of the CIV doublet (λλ 1548 \r{A}, 1550 \r{A}), a rest-frame UV metal line transition detected in HST/COS spectra of 30 halo-star/quasar pairs evenly distributed across the sky at Galactic latitudes |b|>30∘
    - We argue that the difference in absorption between the quasar and stellar sightlines originates primarily in the Milky Way's extended CGM beyond ∼10 kpc.

- [HI Deficiencies and Asymmetries in HIPASS Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03720)
    - Previous studies of galaxy HI deficiency using HIPASS were sensitive to galaxies that are extremely HI rich or poor. We use an updated binning statistic for measuring the global sky distribution of HI deficiency that is sensitive to the average deficiencies.
    - Galaxies residing in denser environments, such as Virgo, are on average more HI deficient than galaxies at lower densities.
    - Many other individual groups and clusters are not found to be on average significantly HI poor
    - We also investigate the correlation between HI asymmetry and deficiency, but find no variation in the mean asymmetry of galaxies that are HI rich, normal or poor.

- [Resolving the Disc-Halo Degeneracy II: NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03991)
    - This mismatch between the scale height and the velocity dispersion can lead to underestimates of the disc surface density and a misleading conclusion of the sub-maximality of galaxy discs.
    - We present the study of the stellar velocity dispersion of the disc galaxy NGC 6946 using integrated star light and individual planetary nebulae as dynamical tracers. We demonstrate the presence of two kinematically distinct populations of tracers which contribute to the total stellar velocity dispersion.
    - We find the disc of NGC 6946 to be closer to maximal with the baryonic component contributing most of the radial gravitational field in the inner parts of the galaxy (Vmax(bar) = 0.76(±0.14)Vmax).

- [More insights into bar quenching. Multi-wavelength analysis of four barred galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04005)
    - We found that for three galaxies, the region between the nuclear or central sub-kiloparsec region and the end of the bar (bar region) is devoid of neutral and molecular hydrogen.
    - While the detected neutral hydrogen is very negligible, we note that molecular hydrogen is present abundantly in the nuclear or central sub-kiloparsec regions of all four galaxies.
    - The study presented here supports a scenario in which gas redistribution as a result of the action of stellar bar clears the bar region of fuel for further star formation and eventually leads to star formation quenching in the bar region.

- [Sustained formation of progenitor globular clusters in a giant elliptical galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04046)
    - **Relevant**
    - We show that many thousands of compact and massive (~5×103−3× 106M⊙) star clusters have formed at an approximately steady rate over, at least, the past ~1Gyr around NGC 1275
    - Their number distribution exhibits a similar dependence with luminosity and mass as the GCs, whereas their spatial distribution resembles a filamentary network of multiphase gas associated with cooling of the intracluster gas.
    - The progenitor GCs have minimal masses well below the maximal masses of Galactic open star clusters, affirming a common formation mechanism for star clusters over all mass scales irrespective of their formative pathways.

    - **CSST**
    - We investigate the accuracy of shear measured with metacalibration from fitting elliptical Gaussians to undersampled galaxy images. In this case, metacalibration introduces aliasing effects leading to an ensemble multiplicative shear bias about 0.01 for Euclid, and even larger for the Roman Space Telescope
    - 克服的方法: computing shapes from weighted moments with wider Gaussians as weight functions, thereby trading bias for a slight increase in variance of the measurements

    - The sample variance is dominated by the connected non-Gaussian (cNG) covariance arising mainly from Poisson number fluctuations of massive clusters in the survey volume. 移除这些能被单独探测到的大质量星系团能降低variance
    - The power spectrum measured from the remaining, diffuse tSZ effects can be used to obtain tight constraints on cosmological parameters as well as the hydrostatic mass bias parameter.

    - SDSS加ELUCID模拟：we develop an extended HOD model that includes the assembly bias of central and satellite galaxies
    - We discover that in many cases the level of cosmic variance between the two simulations can produce biased constraints that lead to an erroneous detection of galaxy assembly bias if the non-constrained simulation is used.
    - Our fiducial ELUCID constraint, for galaxies above a stellar mass threshold M∗=10^10.2h−1M⊙, is Qcen=−0.06±0.09 and Qsat=0.08±0.12, indicating no evidence for a significant galaxy assembly bias in the local Universe probed by SDSS.

- [Accounting for object detection bias in weak gravitationallensing studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04178)
    - We study the impact of object detection for a Euclid-like survey and show that it leads to biases that exceed requirements for the next generation of cosmic shear surveys. In realistic scenarios, blending of galaxies is an important source of detection bias.
    - We find that MetaDetection is able to account for blending, leading to average multiplicative biases that meet requirements for Stage IV surveys, provided a sufficiently accurate model for the point spread function is available.

- [Evidence for galaxy assembly bias in BOSS CMASS redshift-space galaxy correlation function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04182)

    - Recent studies have found that halo concentration by itself cannot capture the full galaxy assembly bias effect and that the local environment of the halo can be an excellent indicator of galaxy assembly bias. 建立了一个HOD模型包含了这两个因素
    - 观测上基于BOSS CMASS：We find that the inclusion of both assembly bias terms is strongly favored by the data and the standard 5-parameter HOD is strongly rejected. 并且能解决Lensing is low问题
    - We also showcase a consistent 3-5sigma preference for a positive environment-based assembly bias that persists over variations in the fit.

- [From "universal" profiles to "universal" scaling laws in X-ray galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04192)
    - **Relevant**
    - We use a semi-analytic model based on a "universal" pressure profile in hydrostatic equilibrium within a cold dark matter halo with a defined relation between mass and concentration to reconstruct the scaling laws between the X-ray properties of galaxy clusters.
    - We also quantify any deviation from the self-similar predictions in term of temperature dependence of few physical quantities like the gas mass fraction, the relation between spectroscopic temperature and its global value, and, if present, the hydrostatic mass bias.
    - By combining these results with the constraints on the observed YSZ−T relation, we show how we can quantify the level of gas clumping affecting the studied sample, estimate the clumping-free gas mass fraction, and suggest the average level of hydrostatic bias present.

    - 利用 LRG cumulative magnitude function at the faint limit进行放大效应改正
    - We fit the large-scale galaxy bias at the effective redshift of the cross-correlation zeff≈0.68 using two different bias evolution agnostic models: a HaloFit times linear bias model where the bias evolution is folded into the clustering-based estimation of the redshift kernel, and a Lagrangian perturbation theory model of the clustering evaluated at zeff

- [Changing-look active galactic nuclei: close binaries of supermassive black holes in action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04417)
    - We demonstrate the extreme case that close binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs) with high eccentricities are able to trigger the CL transition through one orbit. 用双黑洞解释CL-AGN
    - Binary black holes build up their own mini-disks via peeling gas off inner edges of the circumbinary disk during the apastron phase after then they tidally interact with the disks during the periastron phase to efficiently exchange angular momentum (AM) within one orbital period.
    - For mini-disks with rotation retrograde to the orbit, the tidal torque rapidly squeezes the tidal parts of the mini-disks into much smaller radius, resulting in an elevated accretion rapidly and short flares before declining into type-2 AGNs. In case of prograde mini-disks, they gain AM from the binary and rotate outward, giving rise to a rapid turn-off from type-1 to -2.

    - STIS对Haro11的观测：Cluster parameters like stellar mass, dust fraction and dust attenuation, and ionization parameter, obtained through spectral energy distribution fitting, show no correlation with the CIII\] equivalent width (EW), which may be due to a combination of the limitation of the models and the age-homogeneity of the cluster population
    - We find that the clusters with the highest EW(C III\]) can be reconciled only with Cloudy models with an extremely high C/O ratio of ≥ 1.4(C/O)⊙ for an ionizing population of single stars, binary stars, or a mixture of binary stars and active galactic nuclei.

    - Below log(Mstar/Msun)=10.5 satellites are older and metal-richer than equally-massive central galaxies. 但alpha/Fe没有区别
    - We also find that the differences in the median age and metallicity of satellites and centrals at stellar mass below 10^{10.5}Msun are largely due to the higher fraction of passive galaxies among satellites and as a function of halo mass.
    - When accounting for the varying quiescent fraction, small residual excess in age, metallicity and [alpha/Fe] emerge for satellites dominated by old stellar populations and residing in halos more massive than 10^{14}Msun, compared to equally-massive central galaxies. This excess in age, metallicity and [alpha/Fe] pertain to ancient infallers, i.e. satellites that have accreted onto the current halo more than 5 Gyr ago.

    - 3.3 micron PAH:
        - We find LPAH3.3/LIR ∼ 0.1% and the 3.3 μm PAH feature contributes ∼1.5-3% to the total PAH power
        - 可以trace SFR；但是在高光度和低金属丰度时不可靠
        - 3.3 μm is susceptible to attenuation, leading to a factor of ∼ 3 differences in the inferred star formation rate at high obscuration
        - The smallest PAHs are better able to survive under intense radiation fields than presumed, or that PAH emission is shifted to shorter wavelengths in intense and high energy radiation environments.

- [YZiCS: On the Mass Segregation of Galaxies in Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05304)
    - **Relevant**
    - Using deep optical observations of 14 Abell clusters (KYDISC) and a set of hydrodynamic simulations (YZiCS), we find in some cases a hint of mass segregation inside the virial radius. 通过大质量星系比例可以看出；在模拟里更明显
    - Satellites that get accreted at earlier epochs or galaxies in more massive clusters go through more tidal stripping. These effects in combination result in a correlation between the host halo mass and the degree of stellar mass segregation.

    - 基于TNG100：more than 50% of the sample has at least a 10% difference in integrated flux between the high- and low-velocity half of the spectrum, thus the typical TNG100 galaxy has an HI profile that is not fully symmetric.
    - 卫星星系的HI比centrals的更不对称；this trend appears to be driven by the satellite population within the virial radius of haloes more massive than 10^13M⊙, typical of medium/large groups.

    - The central supermassive black hole is clearly overmassive for a host galaxy of that luminosity, but not unprecedented

- [The infrared-radio correlation of star-forming galaxies is strongly M⋆-dependent but nearly redshift-invariant since z∼4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05510)
    - qTIR == L_TIR/L_1.4Ghz; infrared-radio correlation (IRRC)
    - We re-calibrate qTIR as a function of both stellar mass (M∗) and redshift, starting from an M∗-selected sample of >400,000 star-forming galaxies in the COSMOS field, identified via (NUV-r)/(r-J) colours, at redshifts 0.1< z<4.5.
    - We find that the IRRC evolves primarily with M∗, with more massive galaxies displaying systematically lower qTIR. 对红移也有依赖，但是较弱
    - Adding the UV dust-uncorrected contribution to the IR as a proxy for the total SFR, would further steepen the qTIR dependence on M∗.
    - The lower IR/radio ratio in more massive galaxies could be possibly linked to higher SFR surface density, which induces larger cosmic-ray scale heights. 不是因为大质量星系的SFR变弱

    - 作者认为可以排除IMBH：The velocity ellipsoid is very isotropic throughout the cluster, and we argue that this must have been acquired early on. The data prefer the existence of a dark component in this cluster center of 0.8 to 2 percent of the total mass of the cluster 而是一个diffuse dark cluster

    - 两个高红移的radio QSO的延展X-ray探测：The extended X-ray emission is located along the line connecting the core to a radio knot or hotspot, favoring the interpretation of X-ray jets.
    - In the scenario of inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), X-ray jets without a coincident radio counterpart may be common, and should be readily detectable to redshifts even beyond 3.2 due to the (1+z)4 increase of the CMB energy density compensating for the (1+z)−4 cosmological diminution of surface brightness.

    - 利用LISA探测的双白矮星产生的引力波信号：Numerous and widespread DWDs have the potential to probe shapes, masses and formation histories of the stellar populations in the Galactic neighbourhood
    - Using a fiducial binary population synthesis model we find that for large satellites the stellar masses can be recovered to within 1) a factor two if the star formation history is known and 2) an order of magnitude when marginalising over different star formation history models.

    - 看SP特征与星系团形成历史的相关：the most significant dependence of the splashback feature location and scale according to the presence or absence of X-ray emitting galaxy groups in the cluster infall regions.
    - Cluster that do not show massive infalling groups present the splashback feature at a smaller clustercentric radius rsp/r200,m=1.158±0.071 than clusters that are actively accreting groups rsp/r200,m=1.291±0.062, suggesting a correlation between the properties of the cluster potential and its accretion rate and merger history.
    - Clusters that are classified as old and dynamically inactive present stronger signatures of the splashback feature, with respect to younger, more active clusters.

    - We analyse three different samples defined by log10(Mmax[M⊙h−1])=8.5,9.0 and 9.5. On average, our systems have typical sizes of ∼0.2Mpch−1, velocity dispersion of ∼30kms−1 and estimated total mass of ∼10^11M⊙h−1
    - Such large typical sizes suggest that individual members of a given dwarf association reside in different dark matter haloes and are generally not substructures of any other halo. 不是一个结构

    - We apply a theoretical model that predicts the initial cluster mass function as a function of the galactic environment to investigate the origin of DF2's peculiar GC system
    - We predict that the GCs formed in an environment with very high gas surface density, 和现在的diffuse形态对比强烈
    - we propose that the GCs plausibly formed during a major merger at z∼1.3. The merger remnant must have undergone significant expansion of its stellar (and perhaps also its dark matter) component to reach its low present surface brightness

- [Spectroscopic classification of a complete sample of astrometrically-selected quasar candidates using Gaia DR2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05934)
    - **Relevant**
    - We have built a complete candidate sample including 104 Gaia-DR2 point sources brighter than G<20 mag within one degree of the north Galactic pole (NGP), all with proper motions consistent with zero within 2σ uncertainty.
    - 其中大概60%是真的QSO：The selection efficiency of the zero-proper-motion criterion at high Galactic latitudes is thus ≈60%.
    - We find that the surface density of quasars is 20 deg−2, the redshift distribution peaks at z∼1.5, and that only eight systems (13+5−3%) show significant dust reddening.
    - Finally, we discuss how the astrometric selection can be improved to an efficiency of ≈70% by including an additional cut requiring parallaxes of the candidates to be consistent with zero within 2σ.

    - The outflows include at least a component of relatively compact clouds (10^4-10^5Msun) often observed already at a few tens of pc (in projection) from the core

- [The End of Galaxy Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06064)
    - **Interesting**
    - Using an exposure time calculator, we define nominal surveys for extracting the useful information for three science cases: dark energy cosmology, galaxy evolution, and supernovae.
    - For optimistic assumptions, a 280m telescope with a marginally resolved focal plane of 20 deg2 operating at L2 could potentially exhaust the cosmological information content of galaxies in a 10 year survey.
    - We present scaling relations that show how we can progress toward the goal of exhausting the information content encoded in the shapes, positions, and colors of galaxies.

- [Effects of spin on constraining the seeds and growth of ≳10^9M⊙ supermassive black holes in z>6.5 Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06128)
    - We use the observations of 14 Quasars at z>6.5 with mass estimates to constrain their seeds and early growth, by self-consistently considering the spin evolution and the possibility of super-Eddington accretion.
    - If the accretion is coherent with single (or a small number of) episode(s), leading to high spins for the majority of accretion time, then the SMBH growth is relatively slow; and if the accretion is chaotic with many episodes and in each episode the total accreted mass is much less than the SMBH mass, leading to moderate/low spins, then the growth is relatively fast.

    - 借鉴机器学习技术：Neural networks have been developed to learn from high-resolution (HR) image data, and then make accurate super-resolution (SR) versions of different low-resolution (LR) images
    - We are able to enhance the simulation resolution by generating 512 times more particles and predicting their displacements from the initial positions.
    - Furthermore, the generation process is stochastic, enabling us to sample the small-scale modes conditioning on the large-scale environment.

- [Targeted Likelihood-Free Inference of Dark Matter Substructure in Strongly-Lensed Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07032)

    - 也找到了一下 NGC1052-DF2 analogs: These DF2 analogs correspond to relatively massive systems at their infall time which have retained only 3-17 GCs and have been stripped of more than 95% of their dark matter.

- [Tracing the evolution of dust-obscured activity using sub-millimetre galaxy populations from STUDIES and AS2UDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06605)
    - STUDIES 450-μm SMG样本和AS2UDS 850-micron挑选的SMG的比较
    - The fainter 450-μm sample has ∼14 times higher space density than the brighter 850-μm sample at z ≲2, and a comparable space density at z = 2-3, before rapidly declining, suggesting LIRGs are the main obscured population at z ∼ 1-2, while ULIRGs dominate at higher redshifts
    - Using far-infrared luminosity, dust masses and an optically-thick dust model, we suggest that higher-redshift sources have higher dust densities due to inferred dust continuum sizes which are roughly half of those for the lower-redshift population at a given dust mass, leading to higher dust attenuation.

- [HI 21-centimetre emission from an ensemble of galaxies at an average redshift of one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06617)
    - uGMRT观测：z=0.74-1.45 DEEP2 feild的观测; 叠加了7,653 blue, star-forming galaxies
    - We report a measurement of the average HI mass of star-forming galaxies at a redshift z≈1, by stacking their individual HI 21 cm emission signals. We obtain an average HI mass similar to the average stellar mass of the sample.
    - We also estimate the average star-formation rate of the same galaxies from the 1.4 GHz radio continuum, and find that the HI mass can fuel the observed star-formation rates for only ≈1−2 billion years in the absence of fresh gas infall.
    - Gas accretion onto galaxies at z<1 may have been insufficient to sustain high star-formation rates in star-forming galaxies. This is likely to be the cause of the decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density at redshifts below 1.

- [A Fully General, Non-Perturbative Treatment of Impulsive Heating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06632)
    - **Interesting**
    - Impulsive encounters between astrophysical objects are usually treated using the distant tide approximation (DTA) for which the impact parameter, b, is assumed to be significantly larger than the characteristic radii of the subject, rS, and the perturber, rP. The perturber potential is then expanded as a multipole series and truncated at the quadrupole term.

    - Such a correlation is either spurious --in which case it signals an ubiquitous systematic bias in elliptical galaxy observations or their analysis-- or genuine --in which case it implies in particular that at equal luminosity, flattened medium-size elliptical galaxies are on average five times heavier than rounder ones, and that the non-baryonic matter content of medium-size round galaxies is small

- [Clustering of red and blue galaxies around high-redshift 3C radio sources as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06752)
    - Galaxy surface density maps reveal the clustering of red and blue galaxies around 3C radio galaxies and quasars at 1< z<2.5.
    - At z<1.5, the overdensity is dominated by red galaxies, while blue galaxies are more frequent in the periphery. With a few exceptions, the fainter galaxies contributing to the overdensity are bluer than the brighter galaxies
    - This and the brightness and color segregation of candidate cluster member galaxies leads us to conclude that at 1 < z < 1.5 the 3C sources are not just becoming galaxy groups. Rather we suggest that the foundation of a galaxy cluster with luminous red galaxies has largely been set, and the formation of the red sequence is still going on from a reservoir of blue galaxies in the periphery.
    - At z>1.5, overdensities are less frequent and progressively composed of blue galaxies.

    - The measured FeII/MgII flux ratio suggests that the broad line regions of all quasars in the sample are already enriched in iron. 和CII线比，MgII线有蓝移的证据
    - While we find all other broad emission line properties not to be evolving with redshift, the median CIV-MgII blueshift is much larger than found in low-redshift, luminosity-matched quasars

- [Mixture Models for Photometric Redshifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07319)
    - **Useful**
    - We aim at estimates of the full photo-z probability distributions, and their uncertainties. We perform a probabilistic photo-z determination using Mixture Density Networks (MDN).
    - 基于SDSS-WISE观测：We use Infinite Gaussian Mixture models to classify the objects in our data-set as stars, galaxies or quasars, and to determine the number of MDN components to achieve optimal performance.
    -  Infinite Gaussian Mixture Models:
        - The IGMM is the GMM case with an undefined number of components, which will be optimised by the model itself, depending on the photometric data-set used
        - The IGMM describes a mixture of Gaussian distributions on the data population with an infinite (countable) number of components, using a Dirichlet process
    - Mixture Density Network
        - MDNs are a form of ANNs, which are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to a function and its derivatives based on the Universal Approximation Theorem

    - We forecast and optimize the cosmological power of various weak-lensing aperture mass (Map) map statistics for future cosmic shear surveys, including peaks, voids, and the full distribution of pixels 主要优点是可以探测质量分布的non-Gaussian区域
    - We develop a new tomographic formalism which exploits the cross-information between redshift slices (cross-Map) in addition to the information from individual slices (auto-Map) probed in the standard approach.
    - This demonstrates that the complementary cosmological information explored by non-Gaussian Map map statistics not only offers the potential to improve the constraints on the recent σ8 - Ωm tension, but also constitutes an avenue to understand the accelerated expansion of our Universe.

- [Removing the giants and learning from the crowd: a new SZ power spectrum method and revised Compton y-map analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07797)
    - We devise a new method for analysing the y-map by introducing the survey completeness function, conventionally only used in the CNC analysis, in the yy-PS modeling 做两个分析，一个是包含了单独探测到的clusters的，一个是排除的
    - We carefully propagate the effect of completeness cuts on the non-Gaussian error contributions in the yy-PS analysis, highlighting the benefits of masking massive clusters.
    - Our analysis of the Planck yy-PS for the unresolved component yields a mass bias of b=0.15±0.04, consistent with the standard value (b≈0.2), in comparison to b=0.4±0.05 for the total yy-PS.
    - We find indications for this drift being driven by the CIB-tSZ cross correlation, which dominantly originates from clusters in the resolved component of the y-map.

    - We construct a sample of 1188 massive galaxies with logM∗/M⊙>10.75 based on the Galaxy Mass and Assembly (GAMA) survey and measure their total luminosities and g−r colors.
    - We find that galaxies are brighter in the r band by an average of ∼0.05 mag and bluer in g−r colors by ∼0.06 mag compared to the GAMA measurements. 对恒星质量估计的影响不同

Single supernova (SN) blast waves with variable energy are followed within the hydrodynamic calculation to interact with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM)
    - 模拟一个孤立的10^10 Msun的暗物质晕：We demonstrate that the majority of supernovae are Sedov-resolved at our fiducial gas mass resolution of 4M⊙. 能产生外流
    - Clustered SN play a major role in enhancing the effectiveness of feedback, because the majority of explosions occur in low density material.
    - Accounting for variable SN energy affects the metallicity distribution function by altering the efficiency of metal mixing. Additionally, it alters the outflow behaviour, reducing the mass loading by a factor of 2-3 with respect to fixed energy models, thus allowing the galaxy to retain a higher fraction of mass and metals.

    - The updated total number of GCs in both galaxies is 37+11.08−6.54. The number of GCs do not scale with the halo mass in either DF2 or DF4, suggesting that NGC is not directly determined by the merging of halos.

    - We estimate BH masses in the range Log(MBH/M⊙)=8.4-10.8 and Eddington ratios λEdd =0.04-1.3. We confirm that the CIV line width does not correlate with the Balmer lines and the peak of the line profile is blue-shifted with respect to the [OIII]-based systemic redshift. CIV更多指示的是BLR中的外流
    - We confirm the strong dependence of the BLR wind velocity with the UV-to-Xray continuum slope, LBol and λEdd. 质量外流率在0.005-3 Msun/yr

- [On the broad line region configuration of the supermassive binary black hole candidate PG1302-102 in the relativistic Doppler boosting scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07512)
    - We investigate several broad emission lines of PG1302-102 using archived UV spectra obtained by IUE, GALEX, and Hubble, to reveal the broad line emission region (BLR) properties of this BBH system under the Doppler boosting scenario.
    - We find that the broad lines Lyα, NV, CIV, and CIII] all show Gaussian-like profiles, and none of these lines exhibits obvious periodical variation.
    - If the Doppler boosting interpretation is correct, then the BLR is misaligned with the BBH orbital plane by an angle ∼51∘, which suggests that the Doppler boosted continuum variation has little effect on the broad line emission and thus does not lead to periodical line variation.

Spatially thin planes occur in 1-2 per cent of snapshots during z=0−0.2, and kinematically coherent planes occur in 5 per cent of snapshots. 在模拟中一般都不长寿, <500 Myr
        - 但如果存在group accretion的情况，plane则更频发，而且更长寿一些
    - We find that M31's satellite distribution is much more common: M31's satellites lie within about 1 sigma of the simulation median for every plane metric we consider.
    - Baryonic and dark matter-only simulations exhibit similar levels of planarity, even though baryonic subhalos are less centrally concentrated within their host halos.

    - The empirical anisotropy upper limit in real galaxies, and the corresponding observed distributions in the (λR,ε) and (V/σ,ε) diagrams, are due to the lack of physical axisymmetric equilibrium solutions at high β anisotropy when the velocity ellipsoid is close to oblate.

    - We build on this previous work and propose a new model for τmerge that draws on insights derived from these simulations.
    - 旧模型的不足：tend to underpredict τmerge inside the host virial radius (R200) because tidal stripping is neglected, and overpredict it outside R200 because the host mass is underestimated.
    - We find that models that account for orbital angular momentum via the circular radius Rcirc underpredict (overpredict) τmerge for bound (unbound) systems.

    - https://github.com/0satoken/kappaTNG
    - We quantify the baryonic effects on the WL angular power spectrum, one-point probability distribution function (PDF), and number counts of peaks and minima.
    - We find that baryonic processes reduce the small-scale power, suppress the tails of the PDF, peak and minimum counts, and change the total number of peaks and minima.
    - The κTNG suite includes 10,000 realisations of 5×5deg2 maps for 40 source redshifts up to zs=2.6, well covering the range of interest for existing and upcoming weak lensing surveys.

    - LoTSS+JVLA观测：We find that Abell 1430 consists of two components, namely A1430-A and A1430-B. We speculate that the two components undergo an off-axis merger. The more massive component shows diffuse radio emission which can be classified as radio halo showing a low radio power given the mass of the cluster.
    - There is extended diffuse radio emission, dubbed as the `Pillow', which is apparently related to A1430-B and thus related to low density intracluster or intergalactic medium.

    - eFAM successfully removes the anisotropies due to redshift-space distortion at all redshifts including that of the survey, allowing us to decrease the number of free parameters in the model and fit the full-shape of the back-in-time reconstructed 2PCF well beyond the BAO peak.

- [The galaxy "missing dark matter" NGC1052-DF4 is undergoing tidal disruption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09719)
    - **Relevant**
    - Deep optical imaging of the system has detected tidal tails in this object caused by its interaction with its neighbouring galaxy NGC1035.
    - As stars are more centrally concentrated than the dark matter, the tidal stripping will remove a significant percentage of the dark matter before affecting the stars of the galaxy. Only ~7% of the stellar mass of the galaxy is in the tidal tails, suggesting that the stars of NGC1052-DF4 are starting only now to be affected by the interaction

    - 看RPS机制对盘星系旋臂的unwinding作用：We first confirm the unwinding nature, finding the spiral arm pitch angle increases radially in 10 stripped galaxies and also simulated face-on and edge-on stripped galaxies
    - We find only younger stars in the unwound component, while older stars in the disc remain undisturbed.
    - Unwinding can occur due to differential ram-pressure caused by the disc rotation, causing stripped material to slow and "pile-up".
    - The pattern is fairly short-lived (<0.5Gyr) in the stripping process, occurring during first infall and eventually washed out by the ICM wind into the tail of the jellyfish galaxy.

    - MOSFIRE观测4个3.2 < z < 3.7的大质量quiscent星系，利用恒星速度弥散度限制动力学质量:We find high velocity dispersions of order σe∼250 km/s based on strong Balmer absorption lines
    - Investigating the evolution at constant velocity dispersion between z∼3.5 and z∼2, we find a large increase in effective radius 0.35±0.12 dex and in dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio < log(Mdyn/M*)> of 0.25±0.08 dex, with low expected contribution from dark matter.
    - The dynamical masses for our z∼3.5 sample are consistent with the stellar masses for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), with the ratio < log(Mdyn/M∗Ch) > = -0.13±0.10 dex suggesting an IMF lighter than Salpeter is common for massive quiescent galaxies at z>3

    - Bayesian AGN Decomposition Analysis for SDSS Spectra (BADASS)
    - We use BADASS to perform a correlation analysis of 63 SDSS type 1 AGNs with evidence of strong non-gravitational outflow kinematics in the [OIII]λ5007 emission feature.
    - We confirm findings from previous studies that show the core of the [OIII] profile is a suitable surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion σ∗, however there is evidence that the core experiences broadening that scales with outflow velocity.
    - We find sufficient evidence that σ∗, [OIII] core dispersion, and the non-gravitational outflow dispersion of the [OIII] profile form a plane whose fit results in a scatter of ∼0.1 dex.

    - The survivability of the cold gas in the simulated clouds is granted on timescales of the order of 1 Gyr, with final cold gas fractions generally >0.75. 最终的结果是在外部热气体包围下达到压力平衡的对称气体云
    - In our simulation with star formation, star formation begins immediately, it peaks at the earliest times and decreases monotonically with time. Inhomogeneous supernova explosions are the cause of an asymmetric shape of the gas cloud, facilitating the development of instabilities and the decrease of the cold gas fraction.

- [Improvements to Pan-STARRS1 Astrometry Using Gaia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09798)
    - **Useful**
    - The cross match between Gaia and PS1 reveals residuals that are correlated on a scale of about 1 arcmin. We apply a spatially adaptive correction algorithm for all PS1 objects having more than two detections to reduce these residuals and align the object positions to Gaia.
    - The residuals for the corrected positions are smallest for objects with the most point-like morphologies and with intermediate magnitudes of about 17 mag. The residual errors in declination are systematically larger than those in right ascension; the declination errors increase with zenith angle in proportion to the air mass of the observations. Declination positional residuals at a given declination generally vary with color and are consistent with the effects of differential atmospheric refraction.

    - Hbeta宽线有两个成分，中等宽度IC和极宽的成分VBC：The velocity-resolved delays show consistent results: lags of ∼30--50 days at the core of the broad Hβ line and roughly zero lags at the wings. HβIC has a redshift of ∼400 km s−1 which seems to be stable for nearly 30 years by comparing with archived spectra, and may originate from an infall.
    - Both the double-peaked profile and the near-zero lag suggest that HβVBC comes from a region associated with the part of the accretion disc that emits the optical continuum.

    - 19个ZTF TDE的研究：We find that the ZTF sample of TDE hosts is dominated by compact "green valley" galaxies.
    - We present host galaxy spectra which show that E+A galaxies are overrepresented in the ZTF sample by a factor of ≈22
    - The combination of both green colors and high S\'ersic index of the typical TDE host galaxy could be explained if the TDE rate is temporarily enhanced following a merger that leads to a higher central concentration of stars.

- [Degeneracies between baryons and dark matter: the challenge of constraining the nature of dark matter with JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10520)
    - We use a semi-empirical model of galaxy formation to investigate the extent to which uncertainties in the implementation of baryonic physics may be degenerate with the predictions of two different models of dark matter -- Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and a 7 keV sterile neutrino
    - 看z=4的UVLF：We find that while at fixed star formation efficiency, ε, there are marked differences in the abundance of faint galaxies in the two dark matter models at high-z, these differences are mimicked easily by varying ε in the same dark matter model.
    - Our results suggest that JWST will likely be more informative in constraining baryonic processes operating in high-z galaxies than it will be in constraining the nature of dark matter.

    - We also find that the metallicity at which the AMR saturates increases with galaxy mass, which is also found for the field star AMRs. This suggests that relatively low-metallicity clusters can still form in dwarfs galaxies.
    - We suggest that ancient GCs share their formation mechanism with IACs and YMCs, in which GCs are the result of a universal process of star cluster formation during the early episodes of star formation in their host galaxies.

    - We find that CL AGN hosts primarily reside in the so-called green valley that is located between spiral-like star-forming galaxies and dead elliptical 和TDE hosts有类似之处
    - CL AGN hosts have low galaxy asymmetry indicators, suggesting that secular evolutionary processes (the influence of bars and spirals, and possibly minor mergers) might be the primary mechanism for transporting gas to the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) rather than major mergers 星系内的久期演化对提供气体很重要

    - For our choice of stellar yields, our model suggests that the most metal-poor stars were enriched, on average, by N*=5^{+13}_{-3} (1 sigma) Population III stars. 与高红移DLA给出的推断类似
    - The inferred IMF is consistent with that of a Salpeter distribution and there is a preference towards ejecta from minimally mixed hypernovae.
    - We suggest that this method has the potential to constrain the multiplicity of the first generation of stars, but this will require: (1) a stellar sample whose systematic errors are well understood; and, (2) documented uncertainties associated with nucleosynthetic yields.

- [The sensitivity of stellar feedback to IMF averaging versus IMF sampling in galaxy formation simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10533)
    - 模拟里使用的feedback机制是IMF平均过的：star particles are assumed to represent single stellar populations that fully sample the IMF.
    - We find that if supernovae are the only form of feedback, triggering individual supernovae from IMF averaged rates gives identical results to IMF sampling.
    - We find that photoionization is more effective at regulating star formation when IMF averaged rates are used, creating more, smaller H II regions than the rare, bright sources produced by IMF sampling.

- [Dependence of the IRX-β dust attenuation relation on metallicity and environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10538)
    - z=2.0-2.5的field和proto-cluster星系比较：We find no significant dependence of the IRX-β trend on environment.
    - We find that at a given β, IRX is highly correlated with metallicity, and less correlated with mass, age, and sSFR.
    - 金属丰度才是主因：We conclude that, of the physical properties tested here, metallicity is the primary physical cause of the IRX-β scatter, and the IRX correlation with mass is presumably due to the mass dependence on metallicity.
    - UV attenuation curve steepens with decreasing metallicity, and spans the full range of slope possibilities from a shallow Calzetti-type curve for galaxies with the highest metallicity in our sample (12+log(O/H)~8.6) to a steep SMC-like curve for those with 12+log(O/H)~8.3. 使用的消光率不对会对总UV消光和SFR的估计产生很大的影响

    - Observe clear trends of Nout and Vmax with increasing SFR in high-ion-traced outflows, with a stronger (> 3σ) Vmax−SFR correlation 高电离气体的外流可以SF挂钩
    - The kinematic correlations of warm outflows (traced by high-ions) with SFR are similar to those observed for star-forming galaxies at low redshifts. The correlations with SFR are weaker in low-ion species

    - The luminosity and photon rate at later epochs are approx 6.2 and approx 1.7 times higher than thresholds suggested in the literature above which all the neutral hydrogen in the AGN host galaxy is expected to be ionised. The detection demonstrates that neutral hydrogen can survive in the host galaxies of AGNs with high ultraviolet luminosities.

    - RP既能quench也能trigger SF; depending on the strength of the winds. HI and H2 in the outer galactic disk are significantly stripped in the presence of the moderate winds, whereas turbulent pressure provides support against ram pressure in the central region where star formation is active.
    - Moderate ICM winds能加速气体坍缩，提升SFR；Strong wind能快速移除气体, suppressing the star formation by a factor of two within ~200 Myr.

    - QSO：he DESI survey will measure large-scale structure using quasars as direct tracers of dark matter in the redshift range 0.9< z<2.1 and using quasar Ly-α forests at z>2.1. We present two methods to select candidate quasars for DESI based on imaging in three optical (g,r,z) and two infrared (W1,W2) bands.
    - ELG：The selection consists of a g-band magnitude cut and a (g−r) vs. (r−z) color box, which we validate using HSC/PDR2 photometric redshifts and DEEP2 spectroscopy. The ELG target density should be ∼2400 deg−2, with ∼65% of ELG redshifts reliably within a redshift range of 0.6< z<1.6.
    - LRG：Here we present a preliminary version of the DESI LRG target selection developed using Legacy Surveys Data Release 8 g, r, z and W1 photometry. This selection yields a sample with a uniform surface density of ∼600 deg−2and very low predicted stellar contamination and redshift failure rates.
    - BGS: DESI BGS will comprise two target classes: (i) BRIGHT (r<19.5~mag), and (ii) FAINT (19.5< r<20~mag). The selection results in a total density of ∼800 objects/deg2 for the BRIGHT and ∼600 objects/deg2 for the FAINT selections.

    - 关于最近从redMaPPer cluster中相空间里看到的edge：Because the spatial extent of a cluster is correlated with the amplitude of the velocity dispersion profile, we can utilise this feature as a gravity-calibrated standard ruler. Specifically, the amplitude of the velocity dispersion data allows us to infer the physical cluster size.
    - Assuming the relation between cluster radius and cluster velocity dispersion can be calibrated from simulations, we forecast that with existing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) we will be able to measure the Hubble constant with 3% precision.

    - We use the GIZMO code with the MFM mesh-free Lagrangian MHD method, augmented with new algorithms for gravity, timestepping, sink particle formation and accretion, stellar dynamics, and feedback coupling.
    - Modules for mass-injecting feedback (winds, SNe, and jets) inject new gas elements on-the-fly, eliminating the lack of resolution in diffuse feedback cavities otherwise inherent in Lagrangian methods.

    - https://github.com/maxwelltsai/DeepGalaxy
    - We propose DeepGalaxy, a visual analysis framework trained to predict the physical properties of galaxy mergers based on their morphology. Based on an encoder-decoder architecture, DeepGalaxy encodes the input images to a compressed latent space z, and determines the similarity of images according to the latent-space distance.
    - Without having to carry out expensive numerical simulations, DeepGalaxy makes inferences of the physical properties of galaxy mergers directly from images

- [Parsec-scale properties of the radio brightest jetted AGN at z > 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11193)
    - The milliarcsecond angular resolution of our VLBA observations at 1.5, 5 and 8.4 GHz unveils a bright one-sided jet extended for ∼500 parsecs in projection. This high-z radio-loud AGN is resolved into multiple compact sub-components, embedded in a more diffuse and faint radio emission
    - If PSO J0309+27 is a genuine blazar, as suggested by its X-ray properties, then we find that its bulk Lorentz factor must be relatively low (less than 5). Such value would be in favour of a scenario currently proposed to reconcile the paucity of high-z blazars with respect to current predictions

- [The MURALES survey. III. Completing the MUSE observations of 37 3C low-z radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11195)

    - 射电形态和发射线性质可能有联系：In the ten FRI sources the line emission region is generally compact, only a few kpc in size, and only in one case it exceeds the size of the host. Conversely, all but two of the FRII galaxies show large-scale structures of ionized gas.

    - We estimate environmental densities for a subsample of 215 sources by statistically associating them with nearby spectroscopic galaxies from the overlapping GAMA spectroscopic survey. We find that the blue LSBGs are statistically consistent with being spatially randomised with respect to local spectroscopic galaxies, implying they exist predominantly in low-density environments. However, the red LSBG population is significantly spatially correlated with local structure.
    - We find that 26+/-5% of isolated, local LSBGs belong to the red population

- [The Radio Galaxy Population in the SIMBA SImulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11225)
    - Simba grows black holes via gravitational torque limited accretion from cold gas and Bondi accretion from hot gas, and employs AGN feedback including jets at low Eddington ratios.
    - Within RLAGN we define high and low excitation radio galaxies (HERGs and LERGs) based on their dominant mode of black hole accretion: torque limited accretion representing feeding from a cold disk, or Bondi representing advection-dominated accretion from a hot medium.
    - Quiescent galaxies with AGN-dominated radio flux dominate the RLF at > ∼10^22−23 W Hz−1, while star formation dominates at lower radio powers
    - While LERGs dominate among most massive galaxies with the largest black holes and HERGs dominate at high specific star formation rates, they otherwise largely populate similar-sized dark matter halos and have similar host galaxy properties

    - We find EAGLE GV galaxies quench their star formation early, but undergo later episodes of star formation, matching observations. In contrast, IllustrisTNG GV galaxies have a more extended SFH, and quench more effectively at later cosmic times, producing the excess of quenched galaxies in GV compared with SDSS

- [STARFORGE: The effects of protostellar outflows on the IMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11249)
    - Follow the formation of individual stars in giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using the GIZMO code
    - Outflow的作用：Outflows disrupt the accretion flow around the protostar, allowing gas to fragment and additional stars to form, thereby lowering the mean stellar mass to a value similar to that observed.
    - Jet的作用：The effect of jets upon global cloud evolution is most pronounced for lower-mass GMCs and dense clumps, so while jets can disrupt low-mass clouds, they are unable to regulate star formation in massive GMCs. Jets are also unable to stop the runaway accretion of massive stars
    - We conclude that protostellar jets play a vital role in setting the mass scale of stars, but additional physics are necessary to reproduce the observed IMF.

- [Strong Mg II and Fe II Absorbers at 2.2 < z < 6.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11432)
    - Compared with strong Mg II absorbers detected in damped Lyα systems at 2 < z< 4, our absorbers are potentially less saturated and show much larger rest-frame velocity widths. This suggests that the gas traced by our absorbers are potentially affected by galactic superwinds.
    - By using our observed dN/dX of strong Mg II absorbers and galaxy candidates median luminosity, we suggest that at high redshift, strong Mg II absorbers tend to have a more disturbed environment but smaller halo size than that at z< 1.

- [Extreme kinematic misalignment in IllustrisTNG galaxies: the origin, structure and internal dynamics of galaxies with a large-scale counterrotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11581)

    - We show that ≈90% of the stellar counterrotation formed in-situ, in the counterrotating gas.

    - We report a correlation of the colour excess with the difference in the kinematic parameters of the Hβ line and the Ca II Triplet range, which are dominated by young and old stellar populations
    - Our study demonstrates that kinematic differences caused by different stellar populations can be identified in the central regions of nearby galaxies even from intermediate resolution spectroscopy.

    - For a given prescription for the nonlinear power spectrum, using different corrections for baryon physics does not significantly impact the precision of Euclid, but neglecting these correction does lead to large biases in the cosmological parameters.
    - In order to extract precise and unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters from Euclid cosmic shear data, it is therefore essential to improve the accuracy of the recipes that account for nonlinear structure formation, as well as the modelling of the impact of astrophysical processes that redistribute the baryons.

    - The diffuse molecular gas is found in two velocity components separated by dv = 60 km/s, with >99.9% of the total H2 column density concentrated in one component. At a metallicity of ≈ 40% of solar, there is evidence for Fe enhancement and dust depletion, with a dust-to-gas ratio κO≈0.4
    - The closest is a massive, early-type galaxy at d = 41 pkpc which contains 70% of the total stellar mass identified at d <= 310 pkpc of the H2 absorber. The close proximity of the H2-bearing gas to the quiescent galaxy and the Fe-enhanced chemical abundance pattern of the absorber suggest a physical connection.

    - We find that 96% of our candidates are fading sources. This result suggests a scenario where the Universe had its peak of AGN activity somewhere in the past and is dominated by a fading phase at the present time.
    - Around 50% of these fading candidates are associated with merging or interacting systems.

    - Runaway stars, produced by collisional dynamics in young stellar clusters, can travel kilo-parsecs during their main sequence life time.
    - Using galactic-scale hydrodynamic simulations including a treatment of individual stars, we demonstrate that this mechanism enables the ejection of young massive stars into environments where the gas is not dense enough to trigger star formation.

    - Star-forming and quiescent galaxies lie on the same, stable mass FP across 0< z<1, and that the decrease in Mdyn/Lg toward high redshift can be attributed entirely to evolution of the stellar populations.

- [Revealing the Impact of Quasar Luminosity on Giant Lyα Nebulae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12589)
    - **Interesting**
    - 12个z=3.15的QSO，比之前的Lya星云样本更暗：We detect HI Lyα nebulae around 100% of our target quasars, with emission extending to scales of at least 60 physical kpc, and up to 190 pkpc.
    - We show that the surface brightness profiles of the nebulae are similar to those of nebulae around bright quasars, but with a lower normalization.
    - QSO比之前的样本暗约30倍；但Lya Nebulae在20-50 pkpc内只暗了大约4-5倍
    - We find significant correlations between the surface brightness of the nebula and the luminosity of the quasar in both UV continuum and Lyα

- [Ubiquitous Molecular Outflows in z > 4 Massive, Dusty Galaxies I. Sample Overview and Clumpy Structure in Molecular Outflows on 500pc Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12591)
    - We have conducted the first survey of molecular outflows at z > 4, targeting 11 strongly-lensed dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) with ALMA using OH 119um absorption as an outflow tracer
    - We find unambiguous evidence for outflows in 8/11 (73%) galaxies, more than tripling the number known at z > 4. This implies that molecular winds in z > 4 DSFGs must have both a near-unity occurrence rate and large opening angles to be detectable in absorption. 外流非常常见
    - 外流中有很多clump结构：Lensing reconstructions reveal that 500pc-scale clumpy structures in the outflows are common.
    - [CII] 可能不是非常好的外流tracer

- [Coronal Line Forest AGN I: physical properties of the emission-line regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12595)
    - Coronal-Line Forest Active Galactic Nuclei (CLiF AGN) are characterized by strong high-ionization lines, which contrast to what is found in most AGNs
    - By comparing coronal emission-line ratios we conclude that there are no differences between CLiF and non-CLiF AGNs. 并不是那么特殊。
    - We suggest a NLR dominated by matter-bounded clouds to explain the high-ionization line spectrum observed.

- [Turbulent density and pressure fluctuations in the stratified intracluster medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12602)
    - The ICM is density-stratified, with the gas density being highest at the centre of the cluster and decreasing radially outwards. Kolmogorov的湍动理论不适用，因为要求均匀和各向同
    - The gas motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence with the stratification quantified by the perpendicular Froude number (Fr⊥).

- [Powerful t-SNE technique leading to clear separation of type-2 AGN and HII galaxies in BPT diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13037)
    - Based on powerful t-SNE technique applied to the local narrow emission-line galaxies in SDSS DR15, type-2 AGN and HII galaxies can be clearly separated in the t-SNE determined two-dimensional projected map

- [Probing the CGM of Low-redshift Dwarf Galaxies Using FIRE Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13606)
    - 和观测比较，进行了halo质量，恒星质量，红移的match：The FIRE equivalent width (EW) distributions and covering fractions for the C IV ion are broadly consistent with observations inside 0.5Rvir, but are under-predicted for O VI, Mg II, and Si III.
    - The structure and composition of the gas from the simulations exhibit three zones around dwarf galaxies characterized by distinct ion column densities: the disky ISM, the inner CGM (the wind-dominated regime), and the outer CGM (the IGM accretion-dominated regime).
        - Outer CGM已经不完全是由thermal pressure支持的，并不处于流体静力学平衡
    - The net gas inflow rates are comparable to the SFR of the galaxy, but the bulk inflow and outflow rates are greater by an order of magnitude, with velocities comparable to the virial velocity of the halo.
    - This supports a picture for dwarf galaxies in which the dynamics of the CGM at large scales are coupled to the small-scale star formation activity near the centre of their halos.
