- [Can galaxy evolution mimic cosmic reionization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00023)
    - LAE在z>6的下降是否是再电离的影响。其中一个重要假设是星系本身在这阶段演化不大
    - 如果星系内的HI气体随红移增加，或者外流强度随红移下降，都可以模仿出这种效果；但可以通过Lya线的特征来区分
    - Using the CANDELSz7 survey measurements which indicate slightly broader lines at z∼6, we can rule out the scenario of a mere increase in the galactic column density towards higher z. We also show that a decrease in outflow velocity is not ruled out by existing data but leads to more prominent blue peaks at z>6.

- [Line confusion in spectroscopic surveys and its possible effects: Shifts in Baryon Acoustic Oscillations position](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00047)
    - Misidentifying Hβ emitter as [O III] emitter will cause a shift in the inferred radial position of the galaxy by approximately 90 Mpc/h. This length scale is similar to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale and could shift and broaden the BAO peak, possibly introduce errors in determining the BAO peak position.

- [Tightening weak lensing constraints on the ellipticity of galaxy-scale dark matter haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00311)
    - **Relevant**
    - we combine data from five surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS) in order to tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for photometrically selected lens sample
    - fh , the average ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity of the light distribution, finding fh=0.303+0.080−0.079 for red lenses and fh=0.217+0.160−0.159 for blue lenses
    - Our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for the studied red galaxy samples of ⟨|ϵh|⟩=0.174±0.046, where |ϵh|=(1−q)/(1+q) relates to the ratio q=b/a of the minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution.

- [Galaxy clustering in the Legacy Survey and its imprint on the CMB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00466)
    - Cross-correlation of the tomographic galaxy maps with Planck maps of temperature and lensing convergence probe the growth of structure since z=0.8
    - Within ΛCDM, our low amplitude for the lensing cross-correlation requires a reduction either in fluctuation normalization or in matter density compared to the Planck results, so that Ω0.78mσ8=0.297±0.009.

- [A significant excess in major merger rate for AGNs with the highest Eddington ratios at z<0.2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00022)
    - Using ESO VLT/FORS2 B-, V- and color images, we examine the morphologies of 17 galaxies hosting AGNs with Eddington ratios >0.3, and 25 mass- and redshift-matched control galaxies.
    - With a best estimate of 0.41 ± 0.12 for the AGN host galaxies and 0.08 ± 0.06 for the inactive galaxies our results imply that our AGN host galaxies have a significantly higher merger rate
    - We conclude that although major mergers are an essential mechanism to trigger local high Eddington ratio AGNs at z<0.2, the origin of >=50% of this specific AGN subpopulation still remains unclear.

- [A new high-precision strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00027)
    - MUSE观测：We spectroscopically identify 182 multiple images from 48 background sources at 0.9< z<6.2, and 171 cluster member galaxies.
    - 能更好的给出SF clumps的位置：By defining a new metric, which is sensitive to the gradients of the deflection field, we show that we can accurately reproduce the positions of these star-forming knots despite their vicinity to the model critical lines.
    - The high signal-to-noise spectra of the MDLF enables the measurement of the internal velocity dispersion of 64 cluster galaxies, down to m(F160W)=22. This allows us to independently estimate the contribution of the subhalo mass component of the lens model from the measured Faber-Jackson scaling relation

- [A novel black-hole mass scaling relation based on Coronal lines and supported by accretion predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00075)
    - 用发射线比： [Si VI] 1.963 micron/Brγbroad 建立黑洞质量的标度关系; 和黑洞质量有反相关
    - we believe that a key parameter driving this anti-correlation is the effective temperature of the accretion disc, this being effectively sampled by the coronal line gas. 吸积盘温度与黑洞质量的-1/4次方成比例

- [The Faint End of the Quasar Luminosity Function at z∼5 from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00481)
    - HSC-Wide中用Lyman-break挑选的z~5 QSO：we derived the quasar luminosity function at z∼5 covering a wide luminosity range of −28.76<M1450<−22.32 mag.
    - The inferred number density of low-luminosity quasars is lower, and the derived faint-end slope, −1.22+0.03−0.10, is flatter than those of previous studies at z∼5.
