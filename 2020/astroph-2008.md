- [Milky Way Satellite Census. III. Constraints on Dark Matter Properties from Observations of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00022)
    - Our results are consistent with the cold, collisionless DM paradigm and yield the strongest cosmological constraints to date on particle models of warm, interacting, and fuzzy dark matter.

- [Standard candles and sirens rescue H0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00869)
    - 用双中子星并合电磁波对应体观测和SNIa观测联合限制宇宙学：The luminosity distance inferred from these probes and its scatter depend on the underlying cosmology. By using the gravitatonal lensing of light or gravitational waves emitted by, and peculiar motion of, these systems we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the equation of state of dark energy parametrised in the form w0+wa(1−a), along with the Hubble constant and cold dark matter density in the Universe

- [Fast radio bursts to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00007)
    - The occurrence rates of non-repeating and repeating FRBs could be controlled by the cosmic stellar-mass density (CSMD) and star formation-rate density (CSFRD), respectively.
    - 分别给出SKA观测的预测：At z≳2, z≳6 and z≳10, non-repeating FRBs will be detected with the SKA at a rate of ∼104, ∼102, and ∼10 (sky−1 day−1), respectively, if their luminosity function follows the CSMD evolution. At z≳1, z≳2, and z≳4, sources of repeating FRBs will be detected at a rate of ∼103, ∼102, and ≲10 (sky−1 day−1), respectively, assuming that the redshift evolution of their luminosity function is scaled with the CSFRD.

- [Quenched fractions in the IllustrisTNG simulations: comparison with observations and other theoretical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00004)
    - **Relevant**
    - TNG300: The definition used to separate quenched and star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30)% for centrals (satellites) >∼10^10.5M⊙ 增大计算SFR的孔径可以压低quenched fraction
    - Taking projected rather than 3D distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10% due to field contamination. 考虑各种因素后，TNG和观测符合得可以

- [Quenched fractions in the IllustrisTNG simulations: comparison with observations and other theoretical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00004)
    - **Relevant**
    - TNG predicts a quenched fraction of ∼70−90% (on average) for centrals and satellites ≳10^10.5M⊙, regardless of host mass, cosmic time (0≤z≤0.5), clustercentric distance and time since infall in the z=0
    - The fraction of low-mass passive galaxies is higher closer to the host center and for more massive hosts.
    - In fact, ∼30% of group and cluster satellites that are quenched at z=0 were already quenched before falling into their current host, and the bulk of them quenched as early as 4 to 10 billion years ago.

- [SMASHing the low surface brightness SMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00012)
    - SMC的很深的CMD研究：Special care was taken in the decontamination of our data from MW foreground stars, including from foreground globular clusters NGC 362 and 47 Tuc.
    - 重构SBF以及stellar density分布：This approach, based on stellar counts of the oldest main sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars, uncovered a tidally disrupted stellar feature that reaches as far out as 12 degrees from the SMC centre. We also serendipitously found a faint feature of unknown origin located at ∼14 degrees from the centre of the SMC and that we tentatively associated to a more distant structure.

- [MEGARA-IFU detection of extended HeII4686 nebular emission in the central region of NGC1569 and its ionization budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00320)
    - GTC观测：the detection of extended HeII4686 nebular emission in the central region of NGC1569
    - We infer 124+/-11 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in SSC-A using the HeII4686 broad feature and Av=2.3 mag. 这些WR星的电离可以解释HeII线

- [SPT-CL J2032-5627: a new Southern double relic cluster observed with ASKAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00660)
    - ASKAP观测 943 MHz shows two previously undetected radio relics at either side of the cluster； both have steep integrated radio spectra (αSE=−1.33±0.10 and αNW,full=−1.16±0.12
    - These low-power radio relics will become more prevalent in upcoming large-area radio surveys such as the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU).

### Aug 4

- [Characterizing galaxy clusters by their gravitational potential: systematics of cluster potential reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01107)
    - **Relevant**
    - We aim to demonstrate that the systematics associated with cluster gravitational potentials are smaller than the hydrostatic mass bias and that cluster potentials could therefore be a good alternative to cluster masses in cosmological studies.
    - 用模拟验证：We find that the bias in the reconstructed potential (6%) is less than that of the HE mass (13%), and that the scatter in the reconstructed potential decreases by about 35% with respect to that in the HE mass.

- [Galaxy-group (halo) alignments from SDSS DR7 and the ELUCID simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01381)
    - In observation, the major axes of galaxies are found to be preferentially aligned to the major axes of their host groups. 颜色红的central的alignment更强
    - We also find that central galaxies have their major axes to be aligned to the major axes of their corresponding subhalos in the ELUCID simulation 质量越大的halo里信号越强

- [Hot gaseous atmospheres of rotating galaxies observed with XMM-Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01161)
    - **Interesting, Relevant**
    - 看旋转占主导的早型星系的X-ray辐射 We present an analysis of the hot atmospheres of six lenticulars and a spiral galaxy to study the effects of angular momentum on the hot gas properties
    - We find an alignment between the hot gas and the stellar distribution, with the ellipticity of the X-ray emission generally lower than that of the optical stellar emission
    - The entropy profiles of NGC 4382 and the massive spiral galaxy NGC 1961 are significantly shallower than the entropy distribution in other galaxies, suggesting the presence of strong heating (via outflows or compressional) in the central regions of these systems

- [CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING). X. Physical conditions of molecular gas and the local SFR-Mass relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01287)
    - 近邻SFMS星系的Nobeyama CO探测：We find that (1) ratio of 12CO to 13CO lines (R1213) positively correlates to specific star-formation rate (sSFR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.46
    - Our results support the scenario where R1213 variation is mainly caused by the changes in molecular-gas properties such as temperature and turbulence

- [Dynamical state for 964 galaxy clusters from Chandra X-ray images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01299)
    - **Relevant**
    - 多种方式描述X-ray形态和星系团动力学状态：Three widely used indicators for dynamical state, the concentration index c, the centroid shift omega and the power ratio P3/P0 are calculated in the circular central region with a radius of 500 kpc.
    - For a large sample of clusters, the dynamical parameters are continuously distributed from the disturbed to relaxed states with a peak in the between, rather than the bimodal distribution for the two states.
    - The offset between masses estimated from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray images depends on dynamical parameters.

- [LESSER: A Catalogue of Spectroscopically selected sample of Lyman-α Emitters Lensed By Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01361)
    - Search for lensed LAEs in eBOSS: The final catalog contains 361 candidate lensing systems.
    - 0.4 < z < 0.8的LRG作为lens: Among our lensed LAE candidates, 281 systems present single-peaked line profiles while 80 systems show double-peaked features.

- [The halo of M105 and its group environment as traced by planetary nebula populations: I. Wide-field photometric survey of planetary nebulae in the Leo I group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01696)
    - **Relevant**
    - We use PNe as discrete stellar tracers of the diffuse light around M105: We identify 226 PNe candidates within a limiting magnitude of mlim = 28.1 from our Subaru-SuprimeCam imaging, covering 67.6 kpc along the major axis of M105 and the halos of NGC 3384 and NGC 3398.
    - We find an excess of PNe at large radii compared to the stellar surface brightness profile from broad-band surveys: We infer that the radial variation of the PN population properties is due to a diffuse population of metal-poor stars ([M/H] < -1.0) following an exponential profile, in addition to the M105 halo.

### Aug 5

- [Revealing the Local Cosmic Web by Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01738)
    - Here we show that we can reconstruct the Cosmic Web from the galaxy distribution using the convolutional-neural-network based deep-learning algorithm.
    - 在TNG上学习的模型可以重现Eagle的结果；然后应用到Cosmicflow-3上

- [Deconstructing the Planck TT Power Spectrum to Constrain Deviations from ΛCDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01785)
    - we modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to create phenomenological amplitudes, similar to the lensing amplitude parameter AL, for the Sachs-Wolfe, Doppler, early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (eISW), and Polarization contributions to the CMB temperature anisotropy, and then we include these additional amplitudes in fits to the Planck TT power spectrum.
    - 单独考虑每个都不能产生改变，each of these physical effects are being correctly accounted for given the current level of precision.
    - We test adding our phenomenological amplitudes as well as Neff, YHe, and nrun to LCDM + AL and find that none of these model extensions provide significant improvement over LCDM + AL when fitting Planck temperature data.

- [The Halo Spin Transition as a Probe of Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02121)
    - Mass-dependent transitions of the halo spin orientations from the intermediate to the minor principal directions of the local tidal fields can in principle be a useful discriminator of dark energy models.
    - 看在不同的DE模型下，spin transition zone对应的halo质量如何变化
    - Noting that a narrower spin transition zone is more powerful as a probe of dark energy, we also show that the spin transition zones become narrower at higher redshifts, in the filamentary environments and for the case that the tidal fields are smoothed on the smaller scales.
    - Spin transition zone对应的质量区间反应的是潮汐场的非线性演化的速度

- [SUPER-II: Spatially resolved ionized gas kinematics and scaling relations in z~2 AGN host galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01728)
    - SINFONI观测21个Type-I AGN: We detect outflows in all the Type-1 AGN sample based on the w80 value from the integrated spectrum, which is in the range 650-2700 km/s.
    - [OIII] emission is spatially resolved for ∼35% of the Type-1 sample and the outflows show an extension up to ∼6 kpc.
    - The relation between maximum velocity and the bolometric luminosity is consistent with model predictions for shocks from an AGN driven outflow.
    - The escape fraction of the outflowing gas increase with the AGN luminosity, although for most galaxies, this fraction is less than 10%.

- [The nature of CR7 revealed with MUSE: a young starburst powering extended Lyman-α emission at z=6.6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01731)
    - MUSE观测这个有多成分的明亮高红移LAE：We measure extended emission with a similar halo scale length as typical LAEs at z≈5. CR7's Lyα halo is clearly elongated along the direction connecting the multiple components, likely tracing the underlying gas distribution.
    - the MUSE data show that the rest-frame Lyα equivalent width (EW) is ≈100 {\AA}. This is a factor four higher than the EW measured in low-redshift analogues with carefully matched Lyα profiles 但可以用SF解释
    - 大部分的Lya发射都来自最亮的UV成分
    - 不需要AGN来解释：CR7's Lyα emission, while extremely luminous, resembles the emission in more common LAEs at lower redshifts very well and is likely powered by a young metal poor starburst.

- [Statistical correlation between the distribution of Lyα emitters and IGM HI at z∼2.2 mapped by Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01733)
    - 看z=2.2处很强的Lya吸收处附近的星系分布：Combining the sample with the Lyα absorption estimated from 64 (e)BOSS quasar spectra, we find a moderate to strong correlation between the LAE overdensity δLAE and the effective optical depth τLoS in line-of-sights
    - The cross-correlation analysis also clearly suggests that up to 4±1 pMpc, LAEs tend to cluster in the regions rich in HI gas, indicated by the high τLoS
    - we find a 30% excess signal at 2σ level at d<200 pkpc, indicating the dense HI in circumgalactic medium, and a tentative excess at 400< d <600 pkpc in IGM regime

- [Substructure in the Globular Cluster Populations of the Virgo Cluster Elliptical Galaxies M84 and M86](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01737)
    - **Relevant**
    - M84/86附近找GC子结构：a peak in the projected number density of globular clusters in M86 that is offset from the system center and may be at least partly due to the presence of the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 4406B; a bridge that connects the M84 and M86 globular cluster systems; and a boxy iso-density contour along the southeast side of the M86 globular cluster system.
    - 子结构中主要是blue GC population

- [A SOFIA Survey of [CII] in the galaxy M51 II. [CII] and CO kinematics across spiral arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01745)
    - Our data show strong velocity gradients in HI, 12CO, and [CII] at the locations of stellar arms (traced by K--band data) with a clear offset in position-velocity space between upstream molecular gas (traced by 12CO) and downstream star formation (traced by [CII]).
    - Our observations, based on the observed velocity gradients and associated offset between CO and [CII], are consistent with the presence of shocks in spiral arms in the inner parts of M51 and in the arm connecting the companion galaxy, M51b, in the outer parts of M51.

- [Arepo-MCRT: Monte Carlo Radiation Hydrodynamics on a Moving Mesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01750)

- [The Next Generation X-ray Galaxy Survey with eROSITA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01870)
    - eROSITA will contribute significantly to X-ray studies of normal (i.e., not AGN) galaxies.
    - Starting from multi-wavelength catalogues, we measure star formation rates and stellar masses for 60 212 galaxies constrained to distances of 50-200 Mpc. 结合X-ray scaling relation以及eROSITA仪器特性，预测XRB和弥散气体的X-ray光度
    - We predict that the eROSITA 4-year survey, will detect ≳ 15 000 galaxies (3 σ significance) at 50-200 Mpc, which is ~100X more normal galaxies than detected in any X-ray survey to date.

- [A large-scale, regular intergalactic magnetic field associated with Stephan's Quintet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01881)
    - WSRT的Rotation Measure Synthesis观测：We recognise the signature of a large-scale, genuinely regular, magnetised screen, seemingly constrained to the Quintet itself.
    - If indeed associated with the galaxy group in question, it would span a volume of at least 60×40×20kpc and have a strength at least as high as that previously detected within large spiral galaxies. 但仍不能完全排除来自银河系

- [Is extended hard X-ray emission ubiquitous in Compton-thick AGN?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02175)

    - We present the spatial analysis results of a pilot Chandra imaging survey of 7 nearby (0.006< z<0.013) CT AGN: 5/7都有延展硬X-ray发射
    - ESO 137-G034 and NGC 3281 display biconical ionization structures with extended hard X-ray emission reaching kpc-scales (∼ 1.9 kpc and 3.5 kpc in diameter).

- [Inverted metallicity gradients in two Virgo star-forming dwarfs: evidence of recent merging?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02212)
    - 气态丰度测量：The galaxies show positive gas metallicity gradients, contrarily to what is usually found in other dwarfs or in spiral galaxies. We measure gradient slopes of 0.20 ± 0.06 and 0.15 ± 0.03 dex/Re for VCC135 and VCC324
    - The presence of weak underlying substructures in both galaxies and the analysis of morphological diagnostics and of ionised gas kinematics suggest that the inflow of metal-poor gas to the central regions of the dwarfs may be related to a recent merging event with a gas-rich companion.

### Aug 6

- [Artificial intelligence and quasar absorption system modelling; application to fundamental constants at high redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02583)
    - 针对HIRES和ESPRESSO的基于AI的分析工具：The new method forms a sophisticated parallelised system, eliminating human decision-making and hence bias
    - The results show that modelling line broadening for high-redshift absorption components should include both thermal and turbulent components.

- [Exploring reionisation and high-z galaxy observables with recent multi-redshift MWA upper limits on the 21-cm signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02639)
    - We use the latest multi-redshift (z=6.5−8.7) upper limits on the 21-cm signal from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to explore astrophysical models which are inconsistent with the data.
    - We find the vast majority of models disfavoured by the MWA limits are already inconsistent with existing observational constraints. These inconsistent models arise from two classes of models: (i) `cold' reionisation and (ii) pure matter density fluctuations (i.e. no reionisation).

- [Probing the Milky Way's Dark Matter Halo for the 3.5 keV Line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02283)
    - A comprehensive search for the 3.5 keV line, using ∼51 Ms of archival Chandra observations peering through the Milky Way's Dark Matter Halo from across the entirety of the sky.
    - A non-detection is reported in the total data set, allowing us to set an upper-limit on 3.5 keV line flux and constrain the sterile neutrino dark matter mixing angle.
    - Non-detections are reported in all radial data subsets, allowing us to constrain the spatial profile of 3.5 keV line intensity, which does not conclusively differ from Navarro-Frenk-White predictions.

- [REQUIEM-2D: Spatially Resolved Stellar Populations from HST 2D Grism Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02276)
    - **Interesting, CSST**

    - A significant correlation is found between the X-ray–to–optical power-law slope parameter (αOX) and the 2500 ˚A monochromatic luminosity
    - We demonstrate the existence of a population of non-BAL X-ray weak quasars, and the fractions of quasars that are X-ray weak by factors of ≥ 6 and ≥ 10 are 5.8 ± 0.7% and 2.7 ± 0.5%, respectively

- [The MOSDEF-LRIS Survey: The Connection Between Massive Stars and Ionized Gas in Individual Galaxies at z∼2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02277)
    - BPASS+Cloudy拟合z=2.3的rest-UV spectra
    - Our high-SNR subsample is characterized by a median ionization parameter and oxygen abundance, respectively, of log(U)med=−2.98±0.25 and 12+log(O/H)med=8.48±0.11.
    - Accordingly, we find that all galaxies in our sample show evidence for α-enhancement.
    - We find that the local relationship between ionization parameter and metallicity applies at z∼2.
    - The ubiquity of α-enhancement among z∼2.3 star-forming galaxies indicates important differences between high-redshift and local galaxies that must be accounted for in order to derive physical properties at high redshift.

- [Baryons Shaping Dark Matter Haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02404)
    - **Relevant**
    - Fenix和Eagle模拟中的DM halo的DMO和Hydro-run比较
    - Our results indicate that baryons have a significant impact on the shape of the inner halo, mainly within ∼ 20 percent of the virial radius. 在有重子过程的时候，halo变得更spherical
    - Our findings also indicate that disc galaxies preferentially form in haloes whose DMo counterparts were originally more spherical and with stronger velocity anisotropy

- [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: A Range in S0 Properties Indicating Multiple Formation Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02426)
    - **Relevant**
    - A simulated merger pathway involving a compact elliptical and gas-rich satellite results in an S0 that lies within the pressure-supported group. We conclude that two S0 formation pathways are active, with mergers dominating in isolated galaxies and smal groups, and the faded spiral pathway being most prominent in large groups (10^13 < Mhalo < 10^14).

- [The turbulent gas structure in the centers of NGC253 and the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02518)

- [A Wide-area GMRT 610~MHz survey of ELAIS N1 field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02530)
    - The primary goal of the survey was to study the polarised sky at sub-mJy flux densities at < GHz frequencies.

    - 新的统计测量：the probability distribution function (PDF) of relative velocity between two different dark matter halos (i.e. pairwise velocity)
    - We demonstrate that our model of the pairwise velocity PDF provides an accurate mapping of the two-point clustering of massive-galaxy-sized halos at the scales of O(10)h−1Mpc between redshift and real space for a given real-space correlation function.
    - Our model of the pairwise velocity PDF will give a detailed explanation of statistics of massive galaxies at the intermediate scales in redshift surveys, including the non-linear redshift-space distortion effect in two-point correlation functions and the measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

- [The mass function dependence on dark matter haloes dynamical state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03179)
    - **Relevant**
    - 基于MultiDark模拟：We measure the mean relations of concentration, offset and spin as a function of halo mass and redshift and their distributions
    - Halo concentration在大质量端升高；The concentration of low mass haloes shows a faster redshift evolution, especially in the high concentration regime.
    - The offset parameter is smaller at low redshift, in agreement with the relaxation of structures at recent times.
    - 给出一个能预测不同Spin和offset下HMF的模型：This model allows to marginalize over the cool-core bias while constraining cosmological parameters with X-ray selected clusters.

- [Quenching timescales of dwarf satellites around Milky Way-mass hosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02805)
    - DC Justice League模拟里看dwarf satellites的quenched fraction：能够重现比较高的quenched fraction
    - We then trace the histories of satellite galaxies back to z∼15, and find that many satellites with M∗∼10^6−8 solar masses quench within 2 Gyr of infall into the host halo, while others in the same mass range remain star-forming for as long as 5 Gyr.
    - We show that this scatter can be explained by the satellite's gas mass and the ram pressure it feels at infall.
    - 10^8 Msun是一个特征质量，比这个质量更低的卫星的quenching的速度很快

- [Color gradients along the quiescent galaxy sequence: clues to quenching and structural growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02817)
    - **Relevant**
    - CANDELS中的quiescent星系：the youngest quiescent galaxies are not significantly smaller than older quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass.
    - These `post-starburst' galaxies only appear smaller in half-light radii because they have systematically flatter color gradients.
    - 年龄和颜色梯度有相关：越老的星系的color gradient越negative
    - We find that the central mass surface density Σ1 is independent of age at fixed stellar mass, and only weakly depends on redshift. 中心区域的质量基本不变化
    - We find that older quiescent galaxies have additional mass at large radii.

- [Calibrating Mg II-based black-hole mass estimators using Low-to-High-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02990)
    - 用MgII 2798线定single epoch的SMBH质量：We find that the differences in the line profiles between MgII and Hb have significant effects on calibrating the UV \mbh\ estimators.
    - We also find a ∼0.1 dex bias in the \mbh\ estimation due to the difference of the spectral slope in the 2800-5200 \AA\ range

- [NuSTAR hard X-ray spectra of radio galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03293)
    - We present systematic and uniform analyses of 55 NuSTAR spectra for a large sample of 28 radio galaxies, 20 of which are FR II galaxies.
    - The NuSTAR spectra of the majority of our sample are dominated by the thermal corona emission, and the Ecut distribution of the sample is indistinguishable from that of a radio quiet one in literature

### Aug 11

- [A natural boundary of dark matter halo revealed at the minimum bias and maximum infall location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03477)
    - **Relevant**
    - 定义Halo边界：naturally defined in the halo bias profile as the location of the bias minimum in the quasi-linear scale.
    - Correspond to the maximum infall location in the halo velocity profile, demarcating the transition between a growing halo and the environment being depleted.
    - We show that this depletion boundary is approximately proportional to the conventionally defined splashback radius, and can be interpreted as the radius enclosing a highly complete population of splashback orbits.
    - The depletion radius is approximately 2 times the virial radius and encloses an average density of ~10 times the critical density of the universe

- [Learning Spectral Templates for Photometric Redshift Estimation from Broadband Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04291)
    - **Relevant**
    - We learn the underlying spectral energy distributions from an ensemble of ∼100K galaxies with measured redshifts and colors.
    - We show that we are able to reconstruct emission and absorption lines at a significantly higher resolution than the broadband filters used to measure the photometry for a sample of 20 spectral templates.

- [Spectro-polarimetric observations of the CIZA J2242.8+5301 northern radio relic: no evidence of high-frequency steepening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03314)
    - Observations of radio relics at very high frequency (>10 GHz) can help to understand how particles age and are (re-)accelerated in galaxy cluster outskirts and how magnetic fields are amplified in these environments.
    - The resulting best-fit model of the relic spectrum from 145 MHz to 18.6 GHz is a power-law spectrum with spectral index α=1.12±0.03: no evidence of steepening has been found in the new data

- [A new way to constrain the densities of intra-group medium in groups of galaxies with convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03460)
    - ICM的密度对RPS影响很大，但很难从观测上估计：We propose a new way to constrain ρigm through an application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated gas density and kinematic maps galaxies under strong RP
    - 可以应用于WALLABY和SKA的射电观测
    - Trained models are unable to predict the relative velocity of galaxies with respect to the IGM (vrel) precisely, and struggle to generalise for different RP conditions.

- [Vibrationally excited HC3N emission in NGC1068: Tracing the recent star formation in the starburst ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03693)
    - We have detected emission from vibrationally excited HC3N (HC3N*) only towards one star-forming region of the SB ring. Remarkably, HC3N* was not detected towards the CND despite its large HC3N v=0 column density.
    - The very different dust temperatures found for the CND and the proto-SSC indicates that, while the dust in the proto-SSC is being efficiently heated from the inside by the radiation from massive proto-stars, the CND is being heated externally by the AGN, which in the IR optically thin case can only heat the dust to 56 K.

    - QUBRICS巡天： The selection method is based on a machine learning approach applied to photometric catalogs
    - This survey provides a unique sample of bright QSOs at high-z available for a number of cosmological investigations.

- [The Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program. IX. Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Method in the Mega-Maser Host Galaxy, NGC4258 (M106)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04181)
    - 有几何距离测量的星系：we present a detailed study of the apparent magnitude of the TRGB within NGC 4258
    - After quantifying these uncertainties, we measure the TRGB in NGC 4258 to be F814W0 = 25.347 ± 0.014(stat) ± 0.038(sys) mag. 结合几何距离给出TRGB的绝对光度限制
    - This new calibration agrees to better than 1% with an independent calibration presented in Freedman et al. (2019, 2020) that was based on detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) located in the LMC.

- [Dust masses, compositions, and luminosities in the nuclear disks and the diffuse circumnuclear medium of Arp220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04196)
    - We show that the west and east nuclei are powered by central sources deeply enshrouded behind ∼1026 cm−2 column densities of hydrogen with an exponential density distribution, and that the west and east nuclei are optically thick out to wavelengths of ∼1900 and ∼770 μm 但无法确定中心天体的性质
    - [C II] 158μm line cannot be used as a tracer of the star formation rate in heavily obscured systems.
    - Dust inferred gas masses are larger than those inferred from CO observations, suggesting either larger dust-to-H mass ratios, or the presence of hidden atomic H that cannot be inferred from CO observations.

- [Measuring emission lines in J-PAS with artificial neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04287)
    - We used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained and tested with synthetic J-PAS photometry from CALIFA, MaNGA, and SDSS spectra
    - We can reproduce properly the main sequence of star forming galaxies from the determination of the EWs. With the CALMa training set we reach a precision of 0.101 and 0.091 dex for the [NII]/Hα and [OIII]/Hβ ratios in the SDSS testing sample
